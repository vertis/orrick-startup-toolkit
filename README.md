# Orrick Startup Toolkit

[Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP](https://www.orrick.com) has in the past provided a set of startup forms. However as of this writing (2022-08-12) they are not currently available.

I have extracted the last indexed versions of these files from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). Unfortunately not all of the files were archived, so hopefully Orrick will eventually revive their library.

Sourced from [Startup Forms Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20220509013422/https://www.orrick.com/en/Total-Access/Tool-Kit/Start-Up-Forms) and a [list of all media files](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://media.orrick.com/Media%20Library/public/files/*).

I've provided README files for each document. These README files are sourced from the[Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP](https://www.orrick.com) descriptions.

In addition, I've converted them to markdown where possible for maximum reusability.

## General Guidelines for Forms (from Orrick)

As a general matter, you should not make substantive changes to any of the forms included in the Startup Forms Library without checking with your legal counsel. We are constantly improving and updating our forms to keep up with developments in the law and in what's "standard" in the market. As such, you should check here periodically to determine whether you have the latest forms available.

## Terms of Use

I do not own these forms. Use of these forms is bound by the orrick.com [Terms of Use Agreement](https://www.orrick.com/Terms-of-Use-Agreement).

The terms found in [ADDITIONAL_TERMS.md]('./ADDITIONAL_TERMS.md') supplement the orrick.com [Terms of Use Agreement](https://www.orrick.com/Terms-of-Use-Agreement).
