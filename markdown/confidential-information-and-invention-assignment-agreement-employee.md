1.  **[Past and Future Activities]{.underline}**. This Employee

    with the Company. For purposes of clarity, if (a) I performed work,
    activities, or services, or otherwise made efforts, on behalf of the

    my employment relationship if performed during the term of this
    Agreement or (b) within one (1) year after my employment
    relationship with the Company ends I become reemployed by any member
    of the Company Group, then, unless the Company and I otherwise agree
    in writing, this Agreement shall apply to all such past and future
    work, activities, services, and efforts. Without limiting the
    foregoing, the "[Relationship]{.underline}" refers to my employment
    relationship with the Company, whether commenced before, on, or
    after the Effective Date.[^1]

2.  **[Confidentiality]{.underline}**.

3.  **[Confidential Information Definition]{.underline}**.
    "[Confidential Information]{.underline}" means any and all
    information and physical manifestations thereof not generally known
    or available outside the Company Group and information and physical
    manifestations thereof entrusted to the Company Group in confidence
    by third parties, whether or not such information is patentable,
    copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable, and without regard
    to whether such information and physical manifestations thereof are
    marked or otherwise designated as "confidential", "proprietary", or
    something similar. Confidential Information includes, without
    limitation: (i) Company IP (as defined below); (ii) IP owned or
    licensed by the Company Group prior to or outside of this
    Agreement; (iii) Company Data (as defined below) that I receive,

    or information relating to, suppliers and customers (including, but

    share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information,
    business plans, financial forecasts, historical financial data,
    budgets or other business information disclosed to me by the Company
    Group either directly or indirectly, whether in writing,
    electronically, orally, or by observation. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, Confidential Information does [not]{.underline} include
    information that is generally available to and known by the public
    through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under
    confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved.

4.  **[Protection of Information]{.underline}**. I understand that
    during the Relationship, the Company intends to provide me with
    certain information, including Confidential Information, without
    which I would not be able to perform my duties to or for the
    Company. At all times during the Relationship and thereafter, I
    shall hold any and all Confidential Information that I obtain,
    access, or create during the Relationship in strictest confidence,
    shall not use such Confidential Information except for the Company's
    benefit and to the extent necessary to perform my obligations to the
    Company in connection with the Relationship, and shall not disclose
    such Confidential Information to any third party without written
    authorization from the Company in each instance. I shall comply with
    the foregoing obligations whether or not during working hours, until
    the information at issue is no longer Confidential Information as
    described herein. I will not make copies of any Confidential
    Information (including any documents, records, files, media, or
    other resources containing any Confidential Information) except as
    authorized by the Company or in the ordinary course of my
    obligations to the Company in connection with the Relationship. I
    shall not use Confidential Information in violation of any
    applicable laws.

5.  **[Third Party Information]{.underline}**. During the Relationship
    and thereafter, I will not improperly use or disclose to the Company
    Group any confidential, proprietary or secret information of my
    former employer(s) or any other person, and I will not bring any
    such information onto the Company Group's property or place of
    business or upload or transfer any such information to the Company
    Group's property, devices, or cloud services accounts.

6.  **[Other Rights]{.underline}**. This Agreement is intended to
    supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company Group may
    have in law or equity with respect to the protection of trade
    secrets or confidential or proprietary information.

7.  **[Permitted Disclosures]{.underline}**. Nothing in this Agreement
    shall be construed to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information
    as may be required by applicable law or regulation, or pursuant to
    the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an
    authorized government agency, provided that the disclosure does not
    exceed the extent of disclosure required by such law, regulation, or
    order. To the extent legally permissible, I shall promptly provide
    reasonable advance written notice of any such order to an authorized
    officer of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the
    foregoing:

8.  Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts me (or my attorney)
    from communicating with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or any other applicable
    regulatory authority regarding a possible securities law violation.

9.  Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts me from exercising
    protected rights, including without limitation those rights granted
    under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or otherwise
    disclosing information as permitted by applicable law, regulation,
    or order.

10. ***\[For California-based employees:*** Nothing in this Agreement
    prevents me from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful
    acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any
    other conduct that I have reason to believe is unlawful.**\]**

11. The U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 ("[DTSA]{.underline}")
    provides that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly
    liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the
    disclosure of a trade secret that is made (A) in confidence to a
    federal, state, or local government official, either directly or
    indirectly, or to an attorney; and solely for the purpose of
    reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) in a
    complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding,
    if such filing is made under seal. In addition, DTSA provides that
    an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for
    reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret
    to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret
    information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any
    document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does not
    disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

    listing of any IP on [Exhibit A]{.underline} does not constitute an
    acknowledgement by the Company of the existence or extent of such
    IP, nor of my ownership of such IP.

21. **[Use or Incorporation of Employee Background IP and Excluded
    IP]{.underline}**. If in the course of the Relationship I use or
    incorporate into any of the Company Group's products, services,
    processes, or machines, or create in any Company IP any dependency
    on, any Employee Background IP or Excluded IP, I will promptly so
    inform the Company in writing. Whether or not I give such notice, I
    hereby grant to the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up,
    royalty-free, worldwide, fully transferable and sublicensable
    (through multiple tiers), nonexclusive right and license to practice
    and exploit such Employee Background IP and Excluded IP and to make,
    have made, copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, use, sell,

    such records shall be considered Company IP. The records may be in
    the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data
    or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format. I will
    make the records available to the Company Group on request. I will
    not remove such records from the Company Group's place of business
    or systems except as expressly permitted by the Company's policy
    which may, from time to time, be revised at the Company's sole
    election. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during
    the Relationship and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter,
    I will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of all
    IP that I solely or jointly author, discover, develop, conceive, or
    reduce to practice during the period of, or otherwise in connection
    with, the Relationship for, among other things, the Company to
    determine which IP is Company IP and which is Excluded IP.

24. **[Ownership of Company IP]{.underline}**. The Company Group and I
    intend for all Company IP to be owned solely and exclusively by the
    Company. I acknowledge that, to the extent permitted by law, all
    Company IP consisting of copyrightable subject matter is "work made
    for hire" as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. §101),
    are fully compensated by my salary, and such copyrights are
    therefore owned by the Company. With respect to all other Company
    IP, or to the extent not otherwise vested in the Company by
    operation of law, I will hold in trust for the sole right and
    benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its
    designee, for no additional consideration, all of my right, title
    and interest (including Moral Rights) in and to any and all Company
    IP. I further hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to the Company
    or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that I
    now have or may hereafter have for infringement of any Company IP.
    If I have any rights to Company IP that cannot be assigned to the
    Company, I hereby grant to the Company a perpetual, irrevocable,
    fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, fully transferable and
    sublicensable (through multiple tiers), exclusive right and license
    to practice and exploit such rights and to make, have made, copy,
    modify, prepare derivative works of, use, sell, import, and
    otherwise distribute and commercialize any Company products or
    services that may practice such rights. Without limiting the
    generality of the foregoing, to the extent I have any Moral Rights
    in Company IP that cannot be assigned or exclusively licensed under
    applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any such
    Moral Rights, including without limitation any limitation on
    subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable
    law.

25. **[Further Assurances; Power of Attorney]{.underline}**. During and
    after the Relationship, I agree to reasonably cooperate with the
    Company, at the Company's expense and within the Company's
    timeframe, to: (i) apply for, obtain, perfect, and transfer to the
    Company all Company IP; and (ii) maintain, protect, and enforce the
    same, including without limitation by participating in litigation
    and regulatory proceedings, as well as executing and delivering to
    the Company any and all applications, oaths, declarations,
    affidavits, waivers, assignments, and other documents and
    instruments requested by the Company. I hereby irrevocably grant the
    Company a power of attorney to execute and deliver any such
    documents on my behalf in my name and to do all other lawfully
    permitted acts to transfer the Company IP to the Company and further
    the transfer, issuance, prosecution, and maintenance of all IP
    Rights therein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, if I do not
    promptly cooperate with the Company's requests (and without limiting
    any other rights or remedies the Company may have in such
    circumstances). The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an
    interest and shall not be affected by my subsequent incapacity.

26. \[**[Publicity]{.underline}**. I hereby consent to any and all uses
    and displays by the Company Group and its agents of my name, voice,
    likeness, image, appearance, and biographical information in any
    media, at any time during or after the Relationship, for all
    legitimate business purposes of the Company Group. I hereby forever
    release the Company Group and its directors, officers, employees,
    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages,
    losses, costs, expenses, and liabilities of any kind, arising under
    any legal or equitable theory whatsoever, relating to any such
    permitted use of any of the foregoing.\]

    Company Group may also collect this information through service

    business activities within the scope of the Relationship. I
    acknowledge that failure to adhere to the policies, procedures,
    contractual restrictions and instructions that the Company Group has

    no expectation of any additional compensation, royalties, or other
    payment of any kind in connection with my performance of this
    Agreement, that I will not be subject to undue hardship by reason of
    my full compliance with this Agreement or the Company's enforcement
    thereof, and that this Agreement in itself is not a contract of
    employment for any particular time period and shall not be construed
    as a commitment by the Company or me to continue an employment
    relationship for any particular time period.

45. **[Termination Certification]{.underline}**. In the event of the
    termination of the Relationship, I shall sign and deliver the
    "[Termination Certification]{.underline}" attached hereto as
    [Exhibit]{.underline} [C]{.underline}; however, my failure to sign
    and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish
    my continuing obligations under this Agreement.

46. **[Miscellaneous]{.underline}**.

47. **[Governing Law]{.underline}**. The validity, interpretation,
    construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and
    transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the
    parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in
    accordance with the laws of the state of \[*In many cases this
    should be the state where the service provider is located \--*
    *California, Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota and Washington may require
    that certain code sections are attached for individuals\]*
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, without giving effect to
    principles of conflicts of law.

48. **[Entire Agreement]{.underline}**. This Agreement sets forth the
    entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me
    relating to its subject matter and merges and supersedes all prior
    discussions between us. No amendment to this Agreement will be
    effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this
    Agreement. The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any
    rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given
    any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement,
    unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing
    signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being
    understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not
    have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the
    Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board
    of Directors. Any subsequent change or changes in my duties,
    obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or
    scope of this Agreement.

49. **[Successors and Assigns]{.underline}**. This Agreement will be
    binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal
    representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the
    benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.

50. **[Notices]{.underline}**. Any notice, demand or request required or
    permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and
    shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight
    courier or sent by email, or forty-eight (48) hours after being
    deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with
    postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such
    party's address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently
    modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the
    signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the
    Company's books and records.

51. **[Severability]{.underline}**. If one or more of the provisions in
    this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any
    context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the
    fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the
    validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be
    affected. The Company and I have attempted to limit my right to use,
    maintain and disclose the Company Group's Confidential Information,
    and to limit my right to solicit employees and customers only to the
    extent necessary to protect the Company Group from unfair
    competition. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that
    the scope of the covenants contained in Section 6 exceeds the
    maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable,
    the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce
    the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be
    reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that
    time.

52. **[Remedies]{.underline}**. I acknowledge that violation of this
    Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and
    therefore I agree that the Company will be entitled to seek
    extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to,
    temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent
    injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other
    security (or, where such a bond or security is required, that a
    \$1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice
    to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a
    breach of this Agreement.

53. **[Advice of Counsel]{.underline}**. I acknowledge THAT, IN
    EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I Have HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE
    ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I Have read and understood
    ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT
    SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING
    OR PREPARATION HEREOF.

54. **[Counterparts]{.underline}**. This Agreement may be executed in
    any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and
    delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together
    shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution via an
    electronic signature system, facsimile copy or scanned image will
    have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and an
    electronic signature, facsimile or scanned image signature will be
    deemed an original and valid signature.

[EXHIBIT B]{.underline}

**Section 2870 of the California Labor Code is as follows:**

\(a\) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an
employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in
an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that
the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the
employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information
except for those inventions that either:

\(1\) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the
invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably
anticipated research or development of the employer; or

\(2\) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

\(b\) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to
require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being
required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against
the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.

**Chapter 765, Section 1060/2 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is as
follows:**

\(1\) A provision in an employment agreement which provides that an
employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in
an invention to the employer does not apply to an invention for which no
equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the
employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own
time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) to the business of the
employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work
performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which purports
to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the public
policy of this State and is to that extent void and unenforceable. The
employee shall bear the burden of proof in establishing that his
invention qualifies under this subsection.

\(2\) An employer shall not require a provision made void and
unenforceable by subsection (1) of this Section as a condition of
employment or continuing employment. This Act shall not preempt existing
common law applicable to any shop rights of employers with respect to
employees who have not signed an employment agreement.

\(3\) If an employment agreement entered into after January 1, 1984,
contains a provision requiring the employee to assign any of the
employee's rights in any invention to the employer, the employer must
also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification
to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention for
which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of
the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's
own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) to the business of the
employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work
performed by the employee for the employer.

**Sections 44-130 of the Kansas Labor and Industries Code is as
follows:**

\(a\) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an
employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in
an invention to the employer shall not apply to an invention for which
no equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information of the
employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own
time, unless:

\(1\) The invention relates to the business of the employer or to the
employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development;
or

\(2\) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for
the employer.

\(b\) Any provision in an employment agreement which purports to apply
to an invention which it is prohibited from applying to under subsection
(a), is to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to
that extent void and unenforceable. No employer shall require a
provision made void and unenforceable by this section as a condition of
employment or continuing employment.

\(c\) If an employment agreement contains a provision requiring the
employee to assign any of the employee's rights in any invention to the
employer, the employer shall provide, at the time the agreement is made,
a written notification to the employee that the agreement does not apply
to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade
secret information of the employer was used and which was developed
entirely on the employee's own time, unless:

\(1\) The invention relates directly to the business of the employer or
to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development; or

\(2\) The invention results from any work performed by the employee for
the employer.

\(d\) Even though the employee meets the burden of proving the
conditions specified in this section, the employee shall disclose, at
the time of employment or thereafter, all inventions being developed by
the employee, for the purpose of determining employer and employee
rights in an invention.

**Section 181.78 of the Minnesota Labor, Industry Code is as follows:**

Subdivision 1. Invention not related to employment. Any provision in an
employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign or
offer to assign any of the employee's rights in an invention to the
employer shall not apply to an invention for which no equipment,
supplies, facility or trade secret information of the employer was used
and which was developed entirely on the employee's own time, and (1)
which does not relate (a) directly to the business of the employer or
(b) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (2) which does not result from any work performed by the
employee for the employer. Any provision which purports to apply to such
an invention is to that extent against the public policy of this state
and is to that extent void and unenforceable.

Subd. 2. Effect of subdivision 1. No employer shall require a provision
made void and unenforceable by subdivision 1 as a condition of
employment or continuing employment.

Subd. 3. Notice to employee. If an employment agreement entered into
after August 1, 1977 contains a provision requiring the employee to
assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in any invention
to an employer, the employer must also, at the time the agreement is
made, provide a written notification to the employee that the agreement
does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies,
facility or trade secret information of the employer was used and which
was developed entirely on the employee's own time, and (1) which does
not relate (a) directly to the business of the employer or (b) to the
employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development,
or (2) which does not result from any work performed by the employee for
the employer.

anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from
any work performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which
purports to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the

unenforceable.

unenforceable by subsection (1) of this section as a condition of
employment or continuing employment.

\(3\) If an employment agreement entered into after September 1, 1979,
contains a provision requiring the employee to assign any of the
employee's rights in any invention to the employer, the employer must
also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification
to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention for
which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of
the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's
own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business
of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably
anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from
any work performed by the employee for the employer.

[EXHIBIT C]{.underline}

TERMINATION CERTIFICATION[^3]

This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I
failed to return, any Confidential Information (as defined in the
Employee Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement
signed by me (the "[CIIAA]{.underline}")) belonging to , a Delaware
corporation (the "[Company]{.underline}"), or any of its current or
future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively,
with the Company, the "[Company Group]{.underline}").

I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the CIIAA,
including the reporting of any IP (as defined therein), conceived or
made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by the CIIAA, and I
acknowledge my continuing obligations under the CIIAA.

I further agree that, in compliance with the CIIAA, I will preserve as
confidential all of the Company Group's Confidential Information (as
defined therein).

I further agree that, in compliance with [Section 6]{.underline} of the
CIIAA, for twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of
my Relationship with the Company, I shall not either directly or
indirectly solicit any of the Company Group's employees or independent
contractors to terminate their relationship with the Company Group,
either for myself or for any other person or entity.

[^1]: **NTD**: Though similar in most respects, contractors will have
    different requirements under their CIIAAs for a variety of reasons
    (including ensuring differential tax and insurance treatment under
    California law), so if an employee transitions to contractor status,
    a new CIIAA should be required for the contractor relationship.

[^2]: **NTD**: This definition should be expanded if employees will
    regularly be exposed to data subject to heightened regulatory
    scrutiny (e.g., FERPA, HIPAA, etc.).

[^3]: **NTD**: For purposes of clarity, this should not be signed at the
    commencement of the Relationship; it should be signed [upon
    termination]{.underline}.
