        behalf of the Company Group or for its benefit, or in
        anticipation of Consultant's involvement with the Company Group
        (whether before or after the inception of the Company) that
        would have been within the scope of Consultant's consulting
        relationship if performed during the term of this Agreement
        or (ii) within one (1) year after Consultant's consulting
        relationship with the Company ends Consultant becomes reengaged
        by any member of the Company Group, then, unless the Company and
        Consultant otherwise agree in writing, this Agreement shall
        apply to all such past and future work, activities, services,
        and efforts. Without limiting the foregoing, the
        "[Relationship]{.underline}" refers to Consultant's consulting
        relationship with the Company, whether commenced before, on, or

3.  **[Expenses]{.underline}**. Consultant shall not be authorized to
    incur on behalf of the Company Group any expenses and will be

    a.  **[Term]{.underline}**. Consultant shall serve as a consultant
        to the Company for a period commencing on the Effective Date
        \[and, unless earlier terminated as provided for herein,
        terminating on \[Insert Date\] **/OR/** the earlier of (i) the
        date Consultant completes the Services to the Company's
        satisfaction hereunder or (ii) the date Consultant has been paid

        termination, Consultant shall be paid for any portion of the
        Services that have been performed prior to the termination.

        breach any of its obligations under this Agreement between the
        Company and Consultant, the non-breaching party may terminate
        this Agreement immediately if the breaching party fails to cure
        the breach within \[five (5) days\] after having received
        written notice by the non-breaching party of the breach or
        default.

    d.  **[Survival]{.underline}**. [Sections 4(d)]{.underline},
        [5]{.underline}, [7]{.underline}, [8]{.underline},
        [9]{.underline}, [10]{.underline}, [11]{.underline}, and
        [15]{.underline} through [19]{.underline} shall survive
        termination or expiration of this Agreement.

5.  **[Independent Contractor]{.underline}**. Consultant's relationship
    with the Company will be that of an independent contractor and not
    that of an employee.

    a.  **[Method of Provision of Services]{.underline}**. Consultant
        shall have sole direction, control and responsibility for
        determining the method, details and means of performing the
        Services. The Company shall not control any manner, method,
        details, or means by which Consultant performs the Services.
        Consultant shall not be permitted to assign, delegate, or
        subcontract all or any part of the Services to any other person
        without the prior written authorization of the Company. If
        Consultant engages any other person to provide all or any part
        of the Services, regardless of whether the Company provides such
        authorization, Consultant shall be fully responsible for each
        such person's performance of, or failure to perform, the
        Services. Such persons are not and shall not be employees of the
        Company, and Consultant shall expressly advise such persons of
        the terms of this Agreement and shall require each such person
        to execute and deliver to the Company a confidential information
        and invention assignment agreement containing terms that are at
        least as protective of the Company as the terms of this
        Agreement. The Company and Consultant acknowledge and agree that
        the Services are outside the usual course of business of the
        Company. Consultant warrants that Consultant is customarily
        engaged in an independently established trade or occupation,
        and/or has an independently established business, and through
        such ventures Consultant operates as an independent contractor
        that provides services (similar to the Services provided under
        this Agreement) to other clients.

    b.  **[No Authority to Bind the Company]{.underline}**. Consultant
        acknowledges and agrees that Consultant has no authority to
        enter into contracts that bind the Company Group or create
        obligations on the part of the Company Group without the prior
        written authorization of the Company.

    c.  **[No Benefits]{.underline}**. Consultant acknowledges and
        agrees that Consultant shall not be eligible for any employee
        benefits offered by the Company and, to the extent Consultant
        otherwise would be eligible for any such employee benefits but
        for the express terms of this Agreement, Consultant hereby
        expressly declines to participate in such employee benefits.

    d.  **[Taxes; Indemnification]{.underline}**. Consultant shall have
        full responsibility for applicable taxes for all compensation
        paid to Consultant under this Agreement, including any
        withholding requirements that apply to any such taxes, and for
        compliance with all applicable labor and employment requirements
        with respect to Consultant's self-employment, sole
        proprietorship or other form of business organization and any
        U.S. immigration visa requirements. Consultant agrees to
        indemnify, defend and hold the Company Group harmless from any
        liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties or
        interest with respect to such taxes, labor or employment
        requirements, including any liability for, or assessment of,
        taxes imposed on the Company Group by the relevant taxing
        authorities with respect to any compensation paid to Consultant
        or any liability related to the withholding of such taxes.

6.  **[Supervision of Consultant's Services]{.underline}**. The Company
    shall not supervise Consultant in the performance the Services. All
    of the Services will be as agreed between Consultant and a duly
    authorized representative of the Company. Consultant will be
    required to report to such individual, or another duly authorized
    representative designated by the Company, concerning the Services
    performed under this Agreement. The nature and frequency of these
    reports will be left to the discretion of the Company.

        confidence by third parties, whether or not such information is
        patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable, and
        without regard to whether such information and physical
        manifestations thereof are marked or otherwise designated as

        other person, and Consultant will not bring any such information
        onto the Company Group's property or place of business or upload
        or transfer any such information to the Company Group's
        property, devices, or cloud services accounts.

    d.  **[Other Rights]{.underline}**. This Agreement is intended to
        supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company Group
        may have in law or equity with respect to the protection of
        trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information.

    e.  **[Permitted Disclosures]{.underline}**. Nothing in this
        Agreement shall be construed to prevent disclosure of

        regulation, or pursuant to the valid order of a court of
        competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency,
        provided that the disclosure does not exceed the extent of
        disclosure required by such law, regulation, or order. To the
        extent legally permissible, Consultant shall promptly provide

            Regulatory Authority, or any other applicable regulatory
            authority regarding a possible securities law violation.

        ii. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts Consultant
            from exercising protected rights, including without

            information as permitted by applicable law, regulation, or
            order.

        iii. The U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016
             ("[DTSA]{.underline}") provides that an individual shall
             not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal
             or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade
             secret that is made (A) in confidence to a federal, state,
             or local government official, either directly or

             or (B) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit
             or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. In
             addition, DTSA provides that an individual who files a
             lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
             suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to
             the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret
             information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x)
             files any document containing the trade secret under seal;
             and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant
             to court order.

            with others) during the Relationship, which such records
            shall be considered Company IP. The records may be in the
            form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic
            data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other
            format. Consultant will make the records available to the
            Company Group on request. Consultant will not remove such
            records from the Company's place of business or systems
            except as expressly permitted by the Company Group's policy
            which may, from time to time, be revised at the Company's
            sole election. Without limiting the generality of the
            foregoing, during the Relationship and for a period of
            twelve (12) months thereafter, Consultant will promptly make
            full written disclosure to the Company of all IP that
            Consultant solely or jointly authors, discovers, develops,
            conceives, or reduces to practice during the period of, or
            otherwise in connection with, the Relationship for, among
            other things, the Company to determine which IP is Company
            IP and which is Excluded IP.

        ii. **[Ownership of Company IP]{.underline}**. The Company Group
            and Consultant intend for all Company IP to be owned solely
            and exclusively by the Company. Consultant will hold in
            trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and
            hereby assigns to the Company, or its designee, for no
            additional consideration, all of Consultant's right, title
            and interest (including Moral Rights) in and to any and all
            Company IP. Consultant further hereby waives and irrevocably
            quitclaims to the Company or its designee any and all
            claims, of any nature whatsoever, that Consultant now has or
            may hereafter have for infringement of any Company IP. If
            Consultant has any rights to Company IP that cannot be
            assigned to the Company, Consultant hereby grants to the
            Company a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up,
            royalty-free, worldwide, fully transferable and
            sublicensable (through multiple tiers), exclusive right and
            license to practice and exploit such rights and to make,
            have made, copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, use,
            sell, import, and otherwise distribute and commercialize any
            of the Company's products or services that may practice such
            rights. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to
            the extent Consultant has any Moral Rights in Company IP
            that cannot be assigned under applicable law, Consultant
            hereby waives and agrees not to enforce any such Moral
            Rights, including without limitation any limitation on
            subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under
            applicable law.

        iii. **[Further Assurances; Power of Attorney]{.underline}**.
             During and after the Relationship, Consultant agrees to
             reasonably cooperate with the Company, at the Company's
             expense and within the Company's timeframe, to: (i) apply
             for, obtain, perfect, and transfer to the Company the
             Company IP; and (ii) maintain, protect, and enforce the
             same, including without limitation by executing and
             delivering to the Company any and all applications, oaths,
             declarations, affidavits, waivers, assignments, and other
             documents and instruments requested by the Company.
             Consultant hereby irrevocably grants the Company a power of
             attorney to execute and deliver any such documents on
             Consultant's behalf in Consultant's name and to do all
             other lawfully permitted acts to transfer the Company IP to
             the Company and further the transfer, issuance,
             prosecution, and maintenance of all IP Rights therein, to
             the fullest extent permitted by law, if Consultant does not
             promptly cooperate with the Company's requests (and without
             limiting any other rights or remedies the Company may have
             in such circumstances). The foregoing power of attorney is
             coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by
             Consultant's subsequent incapacity.

    e.  \[**[Publicity]{.underline}**. Consultant hereby consents to any
        and all uses and displays by the Company Group and its agents of
        Consultant's name, voice, likeness, image, appearance, and
        biographical information in any media, at any time during or
        after the Relationship, for all legitimate business purposes of
        the Company Group. Consultant hereby forever releases the
        Company Group and its directors, officers, employees, and agents
        from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, losses,
        costs, expenses, and liabilities of any kind, arising under any
        legal or equitable theory whatsoever, relating to any such
        permitted use of any of the foregoing.\]

        ii. **[Other Parties]{.underline}**. During the Relationship,
            Consultant will not influence any of the Company Group's

            attempt to influence any [^4]customer either directly or
            indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or
            services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or

    services, or those products or services proposed or in development
    by the Company during the term of the Agreement (except for those
    companies, if any, listed on [Exhibit D]{.underline} hereto). If,
    however, Consultant decides to do so, Consultant agrees that, in
    advance of accepting such work, Consultant will promptly notify the
    Company in writing or in email, specifying the organization with
    which Consultant proposes to consult, provide services, or become
    employed by and to provide information sufficient to allow the
    Company to determine if such work would conflict with the terms of
    this Agreement, the interests of the Company or further services
    which the Company might request of Consultant. If the Company
    determines that such work conflicts with the terms of this
    Agreement, notwithstanding Section 4, the Company reserves the right
    to terminate this Agreement immediately. In no event shall any of

    discloses to the Company Group or uses in the course of performance
    of this Agreement, without liability to such third parties.

    respective directors, officers, personnel, successors, and assigns
    from and against all losses, liabilities, taxes, damages, costs, and
    expenses (including attorneys' fees and other legal expenses)
    arising from, in connection with, or otherwise relating to: (a) the
    negligence or more culpable acts or omissions (including gross
    negligence, fraud, and willful misconduct) of Consultant or any

    party's rights resulting in whole or in part from the Company's use
    of the results of the Services performed under this Agreement
    (including any Company IP).

17. **[Limitation of Liability]{.underline}**. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY
    GROUP BE LIABLE TO CONSULTANT OR TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES

    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
    REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY COMPANY TO

    agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any

    the parties' relationship, Consultant's Services or this Agreement
    shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration, including claims
    against the Company Group's current or former employees, officers,
    directors or agents. The arbitrator shall determine arbitrability of
    claims (except as to the Class Waiver). Consultant and the Company
    agree to bring any claim in arbitration before a single JAMS
    arbitrator pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules as agreed by the
    parties or determined by the arbitrator. *See*
    https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/. Consultant and the

    individual basis only, and not on a class, collective,
    representative, or private attorney general act representative basis
    on behalf of others ("[Class Waiver]{.underline}"), to the fullest
    extent permitted by applicable law. Any claim that all or part of
    the Class Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, or void
    may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction. In no
    case may class, collective or representative claims proceed in
    arbitration. **Consultant and the Company waive any rights to a jury
    trial or a bench trial in connection with the resolution of any
    claim under this arbitration agreement** (although either party may
    seek interim emergency relief from a court to prevent irreparable
    harm to their confidential information or trade secrets pending the
    conclusion of any arbitration). Claims will be governed by
    applicable statutes of limitations. This arbitration agreement shall
    be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal
    Arbitration Act. In the event that any portion of this arbitration
    agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall
    be severed and the remainder of the arbitration agreement shall be
    given full force and effect.
