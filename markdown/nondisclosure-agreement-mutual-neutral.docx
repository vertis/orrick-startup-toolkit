Recitals

The parties wish to explore a possible business opportunity of mutual
interest **[\[*Describe: *]{.underline}**regarding
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**[\]]{.underline}**
(the "[Relationship]{.underline}") in connection with which Discloser
has disclosed and/or may further disclose its Confidential Information
(as defined below) to Recipient. This Agreement is intended to allow the
parties to continue to discuss and evaluate the Relationship while
protecting Discloser's Confidential Information (including Confidential
Information previously disclosed to Recipient) against unauthorized use
or disclosure.

Agreement

In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

1.  **[Definition of Confidential Information]{.underline}.**
    "[Confidential Information]{.underline}" means information and
    physical material not generally known or available outside Discloser
    and information and physical material entrusted to Discloser in
    confidence by third parties. Confidential Information includes,
    without limitation: technical data, trade secrets, know-how,
    research, product or service ideas or plans, software codes and
    designs, algorithms, developments, inventions, patent applications,
    laboratory notebooks, processes, formulas, techniques, mask works,
    engineering designs and drawings, hardware configuration
    information, **[\[*Include for biotech:*]{.underline}**regulatory
    information, medical reports, clinical data and analysis, reagents,
    cell lines, biological materials, chemical formulas,**[*End of
    insert for biotech*\]]{.underline}** agreements with third parties,
    lists of, or information relating to, employees and consultants of
    the Discloser (including, but not limited to, the names, contact
    information, jobs, compensation, and expertise of such employees and
    consultants), lists of, or information relating to, suppliers and
    customers, price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market
    share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information,
    business plans, financial forecasts, historical financial data,
    budgets or other business information disclosed by Discloser
    (whether by oral, written, graphic or machine-readable format),
    which Confidential Information is designated in writing to be
    confidential or proprietary, or if given orally, is confirmed in
    writing as having been disclosed as confidential or proprietary
    within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after the
    oral disclosure, or which information would, under the
    circumstances, appear to a reasonable person to be confidential or
    proprietary. \[Notwithstanding any failure to so identify it,
    however, all of the Company's
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be Confidential
    Information of the Company and all of Counterparty's
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be Confidential
    Information of Counterparty.\]

2.  **[Nondisclosure of Confidential Information]{.underline}.**
    Recipient shall not use any Confidential Information disclosed to it
    by Discloser for its own use or for any purpose other than to carry
    out discussions concerning, and the undertaking of, the
    Relationship. Recipient shall not disclose or permit disclosure of
    any Confidential Information of Discloser to third parties or to
    employees of Recipient, other than directors, officers, employees,
    consultants and agents of Recipient who are required to have the
    information in order to carry out the discussions regarding the
    Relationship. Recipient shall take reasonable measures to protect
    the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential
    Information of Discloser in order to prevent it from falling into
    the public domain or the possession of persons other than those
    persons authorized under this Agreement to have any such
    information. Such measures shall include the degree of care that
    Recipient utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a
    similar nature. Recipient shall notify Discloser of any misuse,
    misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential
    Information of Discloser which may come to Recipient's attention.

3.  **[Exceptions]{.underline}.** Notwithstanding the above, information
    disclosed hereunder shall not be considered "Confidential
    Information" as defined herein where Recipient can prove that such
    information:

4.  was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered
    the public domain through no fault of Recipient;

5.  was known to Recipient, without restriction, at the time of
    disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of
    disclosure;

6.  was independently developed by Recipient without any use of the
    Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the
    time of such independent development;

7.  is disclosed generally to third parties by Discloser without
    restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement;

8.  becomes known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other
    than Discloser without breach of this Agreement by Recipient and
    otherwise not in violation of Discloser's rights;

9.  is disclosed with the prior written approval of Discloser; or

10. is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court,
    administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided,
    however, that Recipient shall provide prompt notice of such court
    order or requirement to Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a
    protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.

11. **[Return or Destruction of Materials]{.underline}.** Recipient
    shall, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Discloser, not
    make any copies or duplicates of any Confidential Information. Any
    materials or documents that have been furnished by Discloser to
    Recipient in connection with the Relationship, together with all
    copies of such documentation (if any), shall be promptly returned or
    destroyed by Recipient within ten (10) days after (a) the
    Relationship has been rejected or concluded or (b) the written
    request of Discloser; provided, however, that Recipient may retain
    copies of such materials or documents that are stored on Recipient's
    IT backup and disaster recovery systems until the ordinary course
    deletion thereof.

12. **[No Rights Granted]{.underline}.** Nothing in this Agreement shall
    be construed as granting any rights under any patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property right of Discloser, nor shall this
    Agreement grant Recipient any rights in or to Discloser's
    Confidential Information other than the limited right to review such
    Confidential Information solely for the purpose of determining
    whether to enter into the Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement
    requires the disclosure of any Confidential Information, which shall
    be disclosed, if at all, solely at Discloser's option. Nothing in
    this Agreement requires the Discloser to proceed with the
    Relationship or any transaction in connection with which the
    Confidential Information may be disclosed.

13. **[No Representations Made]{.underline}.** Recipient acknowledges
    that neither Discloser, nor any of its representatives, in the
    course of providing the Confidential Information as contemplated
    hereunder, is making any representation or warranty (express or
    implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information,
    and Recipient assumes full responsibility for all conclusions
    derived from such information. Recipient shall be entitled to, and
    shall, rely solely on representations and warranties made in a
    definitive agreement, if any, relating to the Relationship.

14. **[No Reverse Engineering]{.underline}.** Recipient shall not
    modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from or
    disassemble any software programs contained in the Confidential
    Information of Discloser unless permitted in writing by Discloser.

15. \[*Include if concerned about publicity:***[No
    Publicity]{.underline}.** Neither party shall, without the prior
    consent of the other party, disclose to any other person the fact
    that Confidential Information of Discloser has been and/or may be
    disclosed under this Agreement, that discussions or negotiations are
    taking place between the parties, or any of the terms, conditions,
    status or other facts with respect thereto, except as required by
    law and then only with prior notice as soon as possible to the other
    party.\]

16. **[Notice of Compelled Disclosure]{.underline}.** In the event that
    Recipient or any person to whom Recipient or its representatives
    transmit or have transmitted Confidential Information become legally
    compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
    information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or
    otherwise) to disclose any such Confidential Information, the
    Recipient shall provide the Discloser with prompt written notice so
    that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate
    remedy, or both, or waive compliance with the provisions of this
    Agreement. In the event that the Discloser is unable to obtain a
    protective order or other appropriate remedy, or if it so directs
    the Recipient, the Recipient shall furnish only that portion of the
    Confidential Information that the Recipient is advised by written
    opinion of its counsel is legally required to be furnished by it and
    shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable
    assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded such
    Confidential Information.

17. **[\[*Include if a party is a public company or may be
    soon:*]{.underline}** **[Regulation FD]{.underline}.** Recipient
    understands that Discloser's Confidential Information as well as the
    existence of the discussions concerning the Relationship and the
    terms of the Relationship being contemplated by the parties may be
    deemed material non-public information**[\[*Include if there is a
    trading market:*]{.underline}** and Recipient shall not trade in the
    stock of Discloser while Recipient is in possession of any material
    non-public information conveyed
    hereunder**[\]]{.underline}**.**[\]]{.underline}**

18. **[Common Interest Agreement]{.underline}.** To the extent that any
    Confidential Information provided or made available hereunder may
    include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
    product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning
    pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
    investigations, Recipient and Discloser understand and agree that
    they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and
    it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the
    sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
    diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its
    continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work
    product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential
    Information provided or made available by Discloser that is entitled
    to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
    doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
    protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the
    joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates
    Discloser to reveal material subject to the attorney-client
    privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.

19. **[Term]{.underline}.** The foregoing commitments of each party
    shall survive any termination of the Relationship between the
    parties, and shall continue for a period terminating five (5) years
    from the date on which Confidential Information is last disclosed
    under this Agreement.

20. **[Independent Contractors]{.underline}.** The parties are
    independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement
    shall be construed to constitute the parties as partners, joint
    venturers, co-owners or otherwise as participants in a joint or
    common undertaking.

21. **[Remedies]{.underline}.** Each party's obligations set forth in
    this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect
    Discloser and its business. Due to the unique nature of Discloser's
    Confidential Information, monetary damages may be inadequate to
    compensate Discloser for any breach by Recipient of its covenants
    and agreements set forth in this Agreement. Accordingly, the parties
    each agree and acknowledge that any such violation or threatened
    violation may cause irreparable injury to Discloser and, in addition
    to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or
    otherwise, Discloser shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief
    against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation
    of any such breach by Recipient.

22. **[Miscellaneous]{.underline}.**

23. **[Governing Law]{.underline}**\[**[;
    Jurisdiction]{.underline}**\]**.** The validity, interpretation,
    construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and
    transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the
    parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in
    accordance with the laws of the state of \[California\], without
    giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. **[\[*Include to
    designate jurisdiction: *]{.underline}**Each of the parties hereto
    consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ County,
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**[\]]{.underline}**

24. **[Entire Agreement]{.underline}.** This Agreement sets forth the
    entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the
    subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
    discussions, understandings and agreements, whether oral or written,
    between them relating to the subject matter hereof.

25. **[Amendments and Waivers]{.underline}.** No modification of or
    amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this
    Agreement, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the
    parties to this Agreement. No delay or failure to require
    performance of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a
    waiver of that provision as to that or any other instance.

26. **[Successors and Assigns]{.underline}.** Except as otherwise
    provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and
    obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure
    to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs,
    executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Company may
    assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. No
    other party to this Agreement may assign, whether voluntarily or by
    operation of law, any of its rights and obligations under this
    Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information of Discloser
    may not be assigned without the prior written consent of Discloser,
    unless the assignee shall be the successor entity to the assignor
    upon the dissolution of the assignor in its present form.

27. **[Notices]{.underline}.** Any notice, demand or request required or
    permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and
    shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight
    courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the
    U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid,
    addressed to the party to be notified at such party's address as set
    forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written
    notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the
    most recent address set forth in the Company's books and records.

28. **[Severability]{.underline}.** If one or more provisions of this
    Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the
    parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith. In the
    event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and
    enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision
    shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the
    Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded
    and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in
    accordance with its terms.

29. **[Construction]{.underline}.** This Agreement is the result of
    negotiations between and has been reviewed by each of the parties
    hereto and their respective counsel, if any; accordingly, this
    Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of all of the parties
    hereto, and no ambiguity shall be construed in favor of or against
    any one of the parties hereto.

30. **[Counterparts]{.underline}.** This Agreement may be executed in
    any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and
    delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together
    shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a
    facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and effect as
    execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned signature will
    be deemed an original and valid signature.
