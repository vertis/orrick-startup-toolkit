*\[Signature Page Follows\]*

By your signature and the signature of the Company's representative or
by otherwise accepting or exercising this Option, you and the Company
agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the terms and
conditions of this Notice and the \[Company Name\] \[Stock Plan Name\]
and Stock Option Agreement (which includes the Country-Specific
Addendum, as applicable), both of which are attached to and made a part
of this Notice.

In addition, you agree and acknowledge that your rights to any Shares
underlying this Option will vest only as you provide services to the
Company over time, that the grant of this Option is not as consideration
for services you rendered to the Company prior to your date of hire, and
that nothing in this Notice or the attached documents confers upon you
any right to continue your employment or consulting relationship with
the Company for any period of time, nor does it interfere in any way
with your right or the Company's right to terminate that relationship at
any time, for any reason, with or without cause, subject to Applicable
Laws. Also, to the extent applicable, the Exercise Price Per Share has
been set in good faith compliance with the applicable guidance issued by
the IRS under Section 409A of the Code. However, there is no guarantee
that the IRS will agree with the valuation, and by signing below, you
agree and acknowledge that the Company, its Board, officers, employees,
agents and stockholders shall not be held liable for any applicable
costs, taxes, or penalties associated with this Option if, in fact, the
IRS or any other person (including, without limitation, a successor
corporation or an acquirer in a Change of Control) were to determine
that this Option constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of
the Code. You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the
tax consequences of such a determination by the IRS. For purposes of
this paragraph, the term "Company" will be interpreted to include any
Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.

[STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT]{.underline}

1.  **[Grant of Option]{.underline}.** \[Company Name\], a Delaware
    corporation (the "[Compan]{.underline}y"), hereby grants to the
    person ("[Optionee]{.underline}") named in the Notice of Stock
    Option Grant (the "[Notice]{.underline}"), an option (the
    "[Option]{.underline}") to purchase the total number of shares of
    Common Stock (the "[Shares]{.underline}") set forth in the Notice,
    at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice (the
    "[Exercise Price]{.underline}") subject to the terms, definitions
    and provisions of the \[Company Name\] \[Stock Plan Name\] (the
    "[Plan]{.underline}") adopted by the Company, which is incorporated
    in this Stock Option Agreement (this "[Agreement]{.underline}") by
    reference. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, the terms
    used in this Agreement or the Notice shall have the meanings defined
    in the Plan.

2.  **[Designation of Option]{.underline}.** This Option is intended to
    be an Incentive Stock Option as defined in Section 422 of the Code
    only to the extent so designated in the Notice, and to the extent it
    is not so designated or to the extent this Option does not qualify
    as an Incentive Stock Option, it is intended to be a Nonstatutory
    Stock Option.

Notwithstanding the above, if designated as an Incentive Stock Option,
in the event that the Shares subject to this Option (and all other
incentive stock options granted to Optionee by the Company or any Parent
or Subsidiary, including under other plans) that first become
exercisable in any calendar year have an aggregate fair market value
(determined for each Share as of the date of grant of the option
covering such Share) in excess of USD\$100,000, the Shares in excess of
USD\$100,000 shall be treated as subject to a nonstatutory stock option,
in accordance with Section 5(c) of the Plan.

3.  **[Exercise of Option]{.underline}.** This Option shall be
    exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting/Exercise
    Schedule set out in the Notice, with the provisions of Section 7(c)
    of the Plan, and as follows:

    a.  **[Right to Exercise]{.underline}.**

        i.  This Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share.

        ii. In the event of Optionee's death, Disability or other
            termination of Continuous Service Status, the exercisability
            of this Option is governed by Section 5 below, subject to
            the limitations contained in this Section 3.

        iii. In no event may this Option be exercised after the
             Expiration Date set forth in the Notice.

    b.  **[Method of Exercise]{.underline}.**

        i.  This Option shall be exercisable by execution and delivery
            of the Exercise Agreement attached hereto as
            [Exhibit A]{.underline} or of any other form of written
            notice approved for such purpose by the Company which shall
            state Optionee's election to exercise this Option, the
            number of Shares in respect of which this Option is being
            exercised, and such other representations and agreements as
            to the holder's investment intent with respect to such
            Shares as may be required by the Company pursuant to the
            provisions of the Plan. Such written notice shall be signed
            by Optionee and shall be delivered to the Company by such
            means as are determined by the Company in its discretion to
            constitute adequate delivery. The written notice shall be
            accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for
            the purchased Shares.

        ii. As a condition to the grant, vesting and exercise of this
            Option and as further set forth in Section 9 of the Plan,
            Optionee hereby agrees to make adequate provision for the
            satisfaction of (and will indemnify the Company and any
            Subsidiary or Affiliate for) any applicable taxes or tax
            withholdings, social contributions, required deductions, or
            other payments, if any ("[Tax-Related Items]{.underline}"),
            which arise upon the grant, vesting or exercise of this
            Option, ownership or disposition of Shares, receipt of
            dividends, if any, or otherwise in connection with this
            Option or the Shares, whether by withholding, direct payment
            to the Company, or otherwise as determined by the Company in
            its sole discretion. Regardless of any action the Company or
            any Subsidiary or Affiliate takes with respect to any or all
            applicable Tax-Related Items, Optionee acknowledges and
            agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items
            is and remains Optionee's responsibility and may exceed any
            amount actually withheld by the Company or any Subsidiary or
            Affiliate. Optionee further acknowledges and agrees that
            Optionee is solely responsible for filing all relevant
            documentation that may be required in relation to this
            Option or any Tax-Related Items (other than filings or
            documentation that is the specific obligation of the Company
            or any Subsidiary or Affiliate pursuant to Applicable Laws),
            such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or
            reporting statements in relation to the grant, vesting or
            exercise of this Option, the holding of Shares or any bank
            or brokerage account, the subsequent sale of Shares, and the
            receipt of any dividends. Optionee further acknowledges that
            the Company makes no representations or undertakings
            regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items and does
            not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the
            terms or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate
            Optionee's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any
            particular tax result. Optionee also understands that
            Applicable Laws may require varying Share or option
            valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related
            Items, and the Company assumes no responsibility or
            liability in relation to any such valuation or for any
            calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that
            may be required of Optionee under Applicable Laws. Further,
            if Optionee has become subject to Tax-Related Items in more
            than one jurisdiction, Optionee acknowledges that the
            Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate may be required to
            withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one
            jurisdiction.

        iii. The Company is not obligated, and will have no liability
             for failure, to issue or deliver any Shares upon exercise
             of this Option unless such issuance or delivery would
             comply with the Applicable Laws, with such compliance
             determined by the Company in consultation with its legal
             counsel. Furthermore, Optionee understands that the
             Applicable Laws of the country in which Optionee is
             residing or working at the time of grant, vesting, and/or
             exercise of this Option (including any rules or regulations
             governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor or other
             matters) may restrict or prevent exercise of this Option.
             This Option may not be exercised until such time as the
             Plan has been approved by the holders of capital stock of
             the Company, or if the issuance of such Shares upon such
             exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such
             Shares would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws,
             including any applicable U.S. federal or state securities
             laws or any other law or regulation, including any rule
             under Part 221 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal
             Regulations as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board. As
             a condition to the exercise of this Option, the Company may
             require Optionee to make any representation and warranty to
             the Company as may be required by the Applicable Laws.
             Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the
             Shares shall be considered transferred to Optionee on the
             date on which this Option is exercised with respect to such
             Shares, subject to Applicable Laws.

        iv. Subject to compliance with Applicable Laws, this Option
            shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company
            of the appropriate written notice of exercise accompanied by
            the Exercise Price and the satisfaction of any applicable
            obligations described in Section 3(b)(ii) above.

4.  **[Method of Payment]{.underline}.** Unless otherwise specified by
    the Company in its sole discretion to comply with Applicable Laws or
    facilitate the administration of the Plan, payment of the Exercise
    Price shall be by cash or check or, following the initial public
    offering of the Company's Common Stock, by Cashless Exercise
    pursuant to which the Optionee delivers an irrevocable direction to
    a securities broker (on a form prescribed by the Company and
    according to a procedure established by the Company).

Optionee understands and agrees that, if required by the Company or
Applicable Laws, any cross-border cash remittance made to exercise this
Option or transfer proceeds received upon the sale of Shares must be
made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered
foreign exchange agency and may require Optionee to provide to such
entity certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, Optionee
understands and agrees that the future value of the underlying Shares is
unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and may decrease in
value, even below the Exercise Price. Optionee understands that neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any
foreign exchange fluctuation between local currency and the United
States Dollar or the selection by the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency
exchange rate that may affect the value of the Option (or the
calculation of income or Tax-Related Items thereunder).

5.  **[Termination of Relationship]{.underline}.** Following the date of
    termination of Optionee's Continuous Service Status for any reason
    (the "[Termination Date]{.underline}"), Optionee may exercise this
    Option only as set forth in the Notice and this Section 5. If
    Optionee does not exercise this Option within the Termination Period
    set forth in the Notice or the termination periods set forth below,
    this Option shall terminate in its entirety. In no event may any
    Option be exercised after the Expiration Date of this Option as set
    forth in the Notice. For the avoidance of doubt and for purposes of
    this Option only, termination of Continuous Service Status and the
    Termination Date will be deemed to occur as of the date Optionee is
    no longer actively providing services as an Employee or Consultant
    (except, in certain circumstances, to the extent Optionee is on a
    Company-approved leave of absence and subject to any Company policy
    or Applicable Laws regarding such leaves) and will not be extended
    by any notice period or "garden leave" that may be required
    contractually or under Applicable Laws, unless otherwise determined
    by the Company in its sole discretion.

    a.  **[General Termination]{.underline}.** In the event of
        termination of Optionee's Continuous Service Status other than
        as a result of Optionee's Disability or death or Optionee's
        termination for Cause, Optionee may, to the extent Optionee is
        vested in the Optioned Stock, exercise this Option during the
        Termination Period set forth in the Notice.

    b.  **[Termination upon Disability of Optionee]{.underline}.** In
        the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Service Status
        as a result of Optionee's Disability, Optionee may, but only
        within \[12\] month(s) following the Termination Date, exercise
        this Option to the extent Optionee is vested in the Optioned
        Stock.

    c.  **[Death of Optionee]{.underline}.** In the event of termination
        of Optionee's Continuous Service Status as a result of
        Optionee's death, or in the event of Optionee's death within
        \[3\] month(s) following Optionee's Termination Date, this
        Option may be exercised at any time within \[12\] month(s)
        following the Termination Date, or if later, \[12\] month(s)
        following the date of death by any beneficiaries designated in
        accordance with Section \[16\] of the Plan or, if there are no
        such beneficiaries, by the Optionee's estate, or by a person who
        acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or
        inheritance, but only to the extent Optionee is vested in the
        Optioned Stock.

    d.  **[Termination for Cause]{.underline}.** In the event of
        termination of Optionee's Continuous Service Status for Cause,
        this Option (including any vested portion thereof) shall
        immediately terminate in its entirety upon first notification to
        Optionee of such termination for Cause. If Optionee's Continuous
        Service Status is suspended pending an investigation of whether
        Optionee's Continuous Service Status will be terminated for
        Cause, all Optionee's rights under this Option, including the
        right to exercise this Option, shall be suspended during the
        investigation period.

6.  **[Non-Transferability of Option]{.underline}.** This Option may not
    be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws
    of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime
    of Optionee only by him or her. The terms of this Option shall be
    binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and
    assigns of Optionee.

7.  **[Lock-Up Agreement]{.underline}.** If so requested by the Company
    or the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering
    of the Company's securities registered under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended, Optionee shall not sell, make any short sale of,
    loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of
    any securities of the Company however or whenever acquired (except
    for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the
    Company or such underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from
    the effective date of the registration statement, and Optionee shall
    execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by
    the underwriters at the time of such offering.

8.  **[Effect of Agreement]{.underline}.** Optionee acknowledges receipt
    of a copy of the Plan and represents that he or she is familiar with
    the terms and provisions thereof (and has had an opportunity to
    consult counsel regarding the Option terms), and hereby accepts this
    Option and agrees to be bound by its contractual terms as set forth
    herein and in the Plan. Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding,
    conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the
    Administrator regarding any questions relating to this Option. In
    the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of the Plan
    and the terms and provisions of the Notice and this Agreement, the
    Plan terms and provisions shall prevail.

9.  **[Imposition of Other Requirements]{.underline}.** The Company
    reserves the right, without Optionee's consent, to cancel or forfeit
    outstanding grants or impose other requirements on Optionee's
    participation in the Plan, on this Option and the Shares subject to
    this Option and on any other Award or Shares acquired under the
    Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
    advisable in order to comply with Applicable Laws or facilitate the
    administration of the Plan. Optionee agrees to sign any additional
    agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
    foregoing. Furthermore, Optionee acknowledges that the Applicable
    Laws of the country in which Optionee is residing or working at the
    time of grant, holding, vesting, and exercise of the Option or the
    holding or sale of Shares received pursuant to the Option (including
    any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange,
    tax, labor, or other matters) may subject Optionee to additional
    procedural or regulatory requirements that Optionee is and will be
    solely responsible for and must fulfill. If applicable, such
    requirements may be outlined in but are not limited to the
    Country-Specific Addendum (the "[Addendum]{.underline}") attached
    hereto, which forms part of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
    provision herein, Optionee's participation in the Plan shall be
    subject to any applicable special terms and conditions or
    disclosures as set forth in the Addendum. The Optionee also
    understands and agrees that if the Optionee works, resides, moves
    to, or otherwise is or becomes subject to Applicable Laws or Company
    policies of another jurisdiction at any time, certain
    country-specific notices, disclaimers and/or terms and conditions
    may apply to him as from the date of grant, unless otherwise
    determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

10. **[Electronic Delivery and Translation]{.underline}.** The Company
    may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related
    to Optionee's current or future participation in the Plan, this
    Option, the Shares subject to this Option, any other Company
    Securities or any other Company-related documents, by electronic
    means. By accepting this Option, whether electronically or
    otherwise, Optionee hereby (i) consents to receive such documents by
    electronic means, (ii) consents to the use of electronic signatures,
    and (iii) if applicable, agrees to participate in the Plan and/or
    receive any such documents through an on-line or electronic system
    established and maintained by the Company or a third party
    designated by the Company, including but not limited to the use of
    electronic signatures or click-through electronic acceptance of
    terms and conditions. To the extent Optionee has been provided with
    a copy of this Agreement, the Plan, or any other documents relating
    to this Option in a language other than English, the English
    language documents will prevail in case of any ambiguities or
    divergences as a result of translation.

11. **[No Acquired Rights or Employment Rights]{.underline}**. In
    accepting the Option, Optionee acknowledges that the Plan is
    established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature,
    and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company
    at any time. The grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and
    does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
    grants of Options, other Awards or benefits in lieu of Options, even
    if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past, and all
    decisions with respect to future grants of Options or other Awards,
    if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. In addition,
    Optionee's participation in the Plan is voluntary, and the Option
    and the Shares subject to the Option are extraordinary items that do
    not constitute regular compensation for services rendered to the
    Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and are outside the scope of
    Optionee's employment contract, if any. The Option and the Shares
    subject to the Option are not intended to replace any pension rights
    or compensation and are not part of normal or expected salary or
    compensation for any purpose, including but not limited to
    calculating severance payments, if any, upon termination.

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to constitute or create
a contract of employment, nor shall it constitute or create the right to
remain associated with or in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate for any particular period of time. This Agreement shall not
interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate to terminate Optionee's employment or service at any time,
subject to Applicable Laws.

12. **[Data Privacy]{.underline}**. ***Optionee hereby explicitly and
    unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, whether
    in electronic or other form, of Optionee's Personal Data (as
    described below) by and among, as applicable, the Company and any
    Subsidiary or Affiliate or third parties as may be selected by the
    Company for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering,
    and managing Optionee's participation in the Plan. Optionee
    understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent will affect
    Optionee's ability to participate in the Plan; without providing
    consent, Optionee will not be able to participate in the Plan or
    realize benefits (if any) from the Option***.

    ***Optionee understands that the Company and any Subsidiary or
    Affiliate or designated third parties may hold personal information
    about Optionee, including, but not limited to, Optionee's name, home
    address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number
    or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any
    shares of stock or directorships held in the Company or any
    Subsidiary or Affiliate, details of all Options or any other
    entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested
    or outstanding in Optionee's favor ("[Personal Data]{.underline}").
    Optionee understands that Personal Data may be transferred to any
    Subsidiary or Affiliate or third parties assisting in the
    implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that
    these recipients may be located in the United States, Optionee's
    country, or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have
    different data privacy laws and protections than Optionee's country.
    In particular, the Company may transfer Personal Data to the broker
    or stock plan administrator assisting with the Plan, to its legal
    counsel and tax/accounting advisor, and to the Subsidiary or
    Affiliate that is your employer and its payroll provider.***

        construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and
        transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of
        the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted
        in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without
        giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For purposes of

        that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts
        of California or the federal courts of the United States located
        in California and no other courts.

    b.  **[Entire Agreement]{.underline}.** This Agreement, together
        with the Notice to which this Agreement is attached and the

        understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between
        the parties related to the subject matter hereof.

    c.  **[Amendments and Waivers]{.underline}.** Except as contemplated
        under the Plan, no modification of or amendment to this
        Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement,
        shall be effective unless in writing signed by the parties to
        this Agreement. No delay or failure to require performance of
        any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of
        that provision as to that or any other instance.

    d.  **[Successors and Assigns]{.underline}.** Except as otherwise
        provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and
        obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and
        inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns,
        heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. The
        Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this
        Agreement. No other party to this Agreement may assign, whether
        voluntarily or by operation of law, any of its rights and
        obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written
        consent of the Company.

    e.  **[Notices]{.underline}.** Any notice, demand or request
        required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be
        in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered
        personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours
        after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or
        registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to

        recent address set forth in the Company's books and records.

    f.  **[Severability]{.underline}.** If one or more provisions of
        this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under Applicable
        Laws, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good
        faith. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually
        agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then
        (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement,
        (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
        such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the
        Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

    g.  **[Construction]{.underline}.** This Agreement is the result of
        negotiations between and has been reviewed by each of the
        parties hereto and their respective counsel, if any;
        accordingly, this Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of
        all of the parties hereto, and no ambiguity shall be construed
        in favor of or against any one of the parties hereto.

        in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
        and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which
        together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution
        of a facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and
        effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned
        signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.

**Country-Specific Addendum**

This Addendum includes additional country-specific notices, disclaimers,
and/or terms and conditions that apply to individuals who are working or
residing in the countries listed below and that may be material to
Optionee's participation in the Plan. Such notices, disclaimers, and/or
terms and conditions may also apply, as from the date of grant, if the
Optionee moves to or otherwise is or becomes subject to the Applicable
Laws or Company policies of the country listed. However, because foreign
exchange regulations and other local laws are subject to frequent
change, Optionee is advised to seek advice from his or her own personal
legal and tax advisor prior to accepting or exercising an Option or
holding or selling Shares acquired under the Plan. The Company is not
providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making
any recommendations regarding Optionee's acceptance of the Option or
participation in the Plan. Unless otherwise noted below, capitalized
terms shall have the same meaning assigned to them under the Plan, the
Notice of Stock Option Grant and the Stock Option Agreement. This
Addendum forms part of the Stock Option Agreement and should be read in
conjunction with the Stock Option Agreement and the Plan.

**Securities Law Notice:** Unless otherwise noted, neither the Company
nor the Shares are registered with any local stock exchange or under the
control of any local securities regulator outside the United States. The
Stock Option Agreement (of which this Addendum is a part), the Notice of
Stock Option Grant, the Plan, and any other communications or materials
that you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not
constitute advertising or an offering of securities outside the United
States, and the issuance of securities described in any Plan-related
documents is not intended for public offering or circulation in your
jurisdiction

[EXHIBIT A]{.underline}

\[Company Name\]

\[Stock Plan Name\]

[EXERCISE AGREEMENT]{.underline}

This Exercise Agreement (this "[Agreement]{.underline}") is made as of
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, by and between \[Company Name\], a
Delaware corporation (the "[Company]{.underline}"), and
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ("[Purchaser]{.underline}"). To
the extent any capitalized terms used in this Agreement are not defined,
they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Company's \[Stock
Plan Name\] (the "[Plan]{.underline}") and the Option Agreement (as
defined below).

1.  **[Exercise of Option]{.underline}.** Subject to the terms and
    conditions hereof, Purchaser hereby elects to exercise his or her
    option to purchase \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares of the Common
    Stock (the "[Shares]{.underline}") of the Company under and pursuant
    to the Plan, the Notice of Stock Option Grant and the Stock Option
    Agreement granted \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the "[Option
    Agreement]{.underline}"). The purchase price for the Shares shall be
    USD\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Share for a total purchase price of
    USD\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The term "[Shares]{.underline}" refers
    to the purchased Shares and all securities received in connection
    with the Shares pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all
    securities received in replacement of the Shares in a
    recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like, and
    all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to
    which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser's ownership of
    the Shares.

2.  **[Time and Place of Exercise]{.underline}.** The purchase and sale
    of the Shares under this Agreement shall occur at the principal
    office of the Company simultaneously with the execution and delivery
    of this Agreement, the payment of the aggregate exercise price by
    any method listed in Section 4 of the Option Agreement, and the
    satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deductions
    or other payments, all in accordance with the provisions of
    Section 3(b) of the Option Agreement. The Company shall issue the
    Shares to Purchaser by entering such Shares in Purchaser's name as
    of such date in the books and records of the Company or, if
    applicable, a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, against
    payment of the exercise price therefor by Purchaser. The Company
    will deliver to Purchaser a stock certificate or, upon request in
    the case of uncertificated securities, a notice of issuance, for the
    Shares as soon as practicable following such date.

3.  **[Limitations on Transfer]{.underline}.** \[*Use if Stock Plan
    contains transfer restrictions:* Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
    that the Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i)
    the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 12 of the Plan, (ii)
    the terms and conditions that apply to the Company's Common Stock,
    as set forth in the Company's Bylaws, \[including (without
    limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section 8.9
    of the Company's Bylaws, \]as may be in effect at the time of any
    proposed transfer (the "[Bylaw Provisions]{.underline}"), and (iii)
    any other limitation or restriction on transfer created by
    Applicable Laws. Purchaser shall not assign, encumber or dispose of
    any interest in the Shares except to the extent permitted by, and in
    compliance with, Section 12 of the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions,
    Applicable Laws, and the provisions below. \] ***OR*** \[*Use ONLY
    IF Stock Plan DOES NOT INCLUDE transfer restrictions:* Purchaser
    acknowledges and agrees that the Shares purchased under this
    Agreement are subject to (i) the terms and conditions that apply to
    the Company's Common Stock, as set forth in the Company's Bylaws,
    \[including (without limitation) certain transfer restrictions set
    forth in Section 8.9 of the Company's Bylaws, \]as may be in effect
    at the time of any proposed transfer (the "[Bylaw
    Provisions]{.underline}"), and (ii) any other limitation or
    restriction on transfer created by Applicable Laws. Purchaser shall
    not assign, encumber or dispose of any interest in the Shares except
    to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with, \[Section 12 of
    the Plan, \] the Bylaw Provisions, Applicable Laws, and the
    provisions below. \]

    a.  **[Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Refusal]{.underline}.**
        Before any Shares held by Purchaser or any transferee of
        Purchaser (either being sometimes referred to herein as the
        "[Holder]{.underline}") may be sold or otherwise transferred
        (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the Company
        shall first, to the extent the Company's approval is required by
        the Plan or any applicable Bylaw Provisions, have the right to
        approve such sale or transfer, in full or in part, and shall
        then have the right to purchase all or any part of the Shares
        proposed to be sold or transferred, in each case, in its sole
        and absolute discretion (the "[Right of First
        Refusal]{.underline}"). If the Holder would like to sell or
        transfer any Shares, the Holder must provide the Company or its
        assignee(s) with a Notice (as defined below) requesting approval
        to sell or transfer the Shares and offering the Company or its
        assignee(s) a Right of First Refusal on the same terms and
        conditions set forth in this Section 3(a). The Company may
        either (1) exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in
        part and purchase such Shares pursuant to this Section 3(a),
        (2) decline to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in
        part and permit the transfer of such Shares to the Proposed
        Transferee (as defined below) in full or in part or (3) decline
        to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and,
        to the extent the Company's approval is required by the Plan or
        any applicable Bylaw Provisions, decline the request to sell or
        transfer the Shares in full or in part.

        i.  **[Notice of Proposed Transfer]{.underline}.** The Holder of
            the Shares shall deliver to the Company a written notice
            (the "[Notice]{.underline}") stating: (A) the Holder's
            intention to sell or otherwise transfer such Shares; (B) the
            name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee
            ("[Proposed Transferee]{.underline}"); (C) the number of
            Shares to be sold or transferred to each Proposed
            Transferee; (D) the terms and conditions of each proposed
            sale or transfer, including (without limitation) the
            purchase price for such Shares (the "[Purchase
            Price]{.underline}"); and (E) the Holder's offer to the
            Company or its assignee(s) to purchase the Shares at the
            Purchase Price and upon the same terms (or terms that are no
            less favorable to the Company).

        ii. **[Exercise of Right of First Refusal]{.underline}.** At any
            time within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, the Company
            and/or its assignee(s) shall deliver a written notice to the
            Holder indicating whether the Company and/or its assignee(s)
            elect to permit or reject the proposed sale or transfer, in
            full or in part, and/or elect to accept or decline the offer
            to purchase any or all of the Shares proposed to be sold or
            transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees,
            at the Purchase Price, provided that if the Purchase Price
            consists of no legal consideration (as, for example, in the
            case of a transfer by gift), the purchase price will be the
            fair market value of the Shares as determined in good faith
            by the Company. If the Purchase Price includes consideration
            other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash
            consideration shall be determined by the Company in good
            faith.

        iii. **[Payment]{.underline}.** Payment of the Purchase Price
             shall be made, at the election of the Company or its
             assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or
             a portion of any outstanding indebtedness, or by any
             combination thereof within 60 days after receipt of the
             Notice or in the manner and at the times set forth in the
             Notice.

        iv. **[Holder's Right to Transfer]{.underline}.** If any of the
            Shares proposed in the Notice to be sold or transferred to a
            given Proposed Transferee are both (A) not purchased by the
            Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this
            Section 3(a) [and]{.underline} (B) approved by the Company
            to be sold or transferred, then the Holder may sell or
            otherwise transfer any such Shares to the applicable
            Proposed Transferee at the Purchase Price or at a higher
            price, provided that such sale or other transfer is
            consummated within 120 days after the date of the Notice;
            provided that any such sale or other transfer is also
            effected in accordance with the Bylaw Provisions \[*Use if
            Stock Plan contains transfer restrictions:* , the transfer
            restrictions set forth in the Plan\] and any Applicable Laws
            and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the Plan,
            the Bylaw Provisions and the provisions of the Option
            Agreement and this Agreement, including this Section 3 and
            the waiver of statutory information rights in Section 8
            shall continue to apply to the Shares in the hands of such
            Proposed Transferee. The Company, in consultation with its
            legal counsel, may require the Holder to provide an opinion
            of counsel evidencing compliance with Applicable Laws. If
            the Shares described in the Notice are not transferred to
            the Proposed Transferee within such period, or if the Holder
            proposes to change the price or other terms to make them
            more favorable to the Proposed Transferee, a new Notice
            shall be given to the Company, and the Company and/or its
            assignees shall again have the right to approve such
            transfer and be offered the Right of First Refusal.

        v.  **[Exception for Certain Family Transfers]{.underline}.**
            Anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3(a)
            notwithstanding, the transfer of any or all of the Shares
            during Holder's lifetime or on Holder's death by will or
            intestacy to Holder's Immediate Family or a trust for the
            benefit of Holder or Holder's Immediate Family shall be
            exempt from the provisions of this Section 3(a). "[Immediate
            Family]{.underline}" as used herein shall mean lineal
            descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse's antecedents),
            father, mother, brother or sister (or their descendants),
            stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or
            uncle (or their antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law
            or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or descendants) and
            shall include adoptive relationships, or any person sharing
            Holder's household (other than a tenant or an employee). In
            such case, the transferee or other recipient shall receive
            and hold the Shares so transferred subject to the provisions
            of the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions and the provisions of the
            Option Agreement and this Agreement, including this
            Section 3 and Section 8, and there shall be no further
            transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms
            of this Section 3\[, the Plan,\] and the Bylaw Provisions.

    ```
    a.  **[Company's Right to Purchase upon Involuntary
        Transfer]{.underline}.** In the event of any transfer by
        operation of law or other involuntary transfer (including death
        or divorce, but excluding a transfer to Immediate Family as set
        forth in Section 3(a)(v) above) of all or a portion of the
        Shares by the record holder thereof, the Company shall have an
        option to purchase any or all of the Shares transferred at the
        Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of transfer (as
        determined by the Company in its sole discretion). Upon such a
        transfer, the Holder shall promptly notify the Secretary of the
        Company of such transfer. The right to purchase such Shares
        shall be provided to the Company for a period of 30 days
        following receipt by the Company of written notice from the
        Holder.

    b.  **[Assignment]{.underline}.** The right of the Company to
        purchase any part of the Shares may be assigned in whole or in
        part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the Company or
        other persons or organizations.

    c.  **[Restrictions Binding on Transferees]{.underline}.** All
        transferees of Shares or any interest therein will receive and
        hold such Shares or interest subject to the Plan, the Bylaw
        Provisions, the provisions of the Option Agreement and this
        Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 3 and 8 of
        this Agreement, Section 7 of the Option Agreement\[ and
        Section 12 of the Plan\]. Any sale or transfer of the Shares
        shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are
        satisfied.

    d.  **[Termination of Rights]{.underline}.** The transfer
        restrictions set forth in Section  3(a) above\[ and Section 12
        of the Plan\], the Right of First Refusal granted the Company by
        Section 3(a) above and the right to repurchase the Shares in the
        event of an involuntary transfer granted the Company by
        Section 3(b) above shall terminate upon the first sale of Common
        Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a
        registration statement filed with and declared effective by the
        Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of
        1933, as amended (the "[Securities Act]{.underline}") (other
        than a registration statement relating solely to the issuance of
        Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee
        incentive or benefit plan) or any transfer or conversion of
        Shares made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory
        consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or
        corporations if the common stock of the surviving corporation or
        any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof is registered
        under the Exchange Act. Upon termination of such transfer
        restrictions, the Company will remove any stop-transfer notices
        referred to in Section 6(b) below and related to the
        restrictions in this Section 3 and a new stock certificate or,
        in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance,
        for the Shares not repurchased shall be issued, on request,
        without the legend referred to in Section 6(a)(ii) below and
        delivered to Holder.

    e.  **[Lock-Up Agreement]{.underline}.** The lock-up provisions set
        forth in Section 7 of the Option Agreement shall apply to the
        Shares issued upon exercise of the Option hereunder and
        Purchaser reaffirms Purchaser's obligations set forth therein.

14. **[Investment and Taxation Representations]{.underline}.** In
    connection with the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser represents to
    the Company the following:

    a.  Purchaser is aware of the Company's business affairs and
        financial condition and has acquired sufficient information
        about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
        decision to acquire the Shares. Purchaser is purchasing the
        Shares for investment for Purchaser's own account only and not
        with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
        "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act
        or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does
        not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any
        other person or entity.

    b.  Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered
        under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption
        therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the
        bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed
        herein.

    c.  Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the
        securities must be held indefinitely unless they are
        subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
        from such registration is available. Purchaser further
        acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no
        obligation to register the securities.

    d.  Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144,
        promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance,
        permits limited public resale of "restricted securities"
        acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the
        securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a
        non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain
        conditions. Purchaser understands that the Company provides no
        assurances as to whether he or she will be able to resell any or
        all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires,
        among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting
        requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities
        take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the
        Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain
        circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume
        and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions.
        Notwithstanding this Section 4(d), Purchaser acknowledges and
        agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 4(e) below.

    e.  Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the
        applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied,
        registration under the Securities Act, compliance with
        Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be
        required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is
        not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to
        sell private placement securities other than in a registered
        offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a
        substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption
        from registration is available for such offers or sales, and
        that such persons and their respective brokers who participate
        in such transactions do so at their own risk.

    f.  Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the
        "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i)
        to (viii) under the Securities Act. Purchaser also agrees to
        notify the Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such
        disqualifications after the date hereof.

    g.  Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax
        consequences as a result of Purchaser's purchase or disposition
        of the Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted
        any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with
        the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is
        not relying on the Company for any tax advice.

15. **[Voting Provisions]{.underline}.** As a condition precedent to
    entering into this Agreement, at the request of the Company,
    Purchaser shall become a party to any voting agreement to which the
    Company is a party at the time of Purchaser's execution and delivery
    of this Agreement, as such voting agreement may be thereafter
    amended from time to time (the "[Voting Agreement]{.underline}"), by
    executing an adoption agreement or counterpart signature page
    agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of the Voting
    Agreement and to vote the Shares in the capacity of a "Common
    Holder" and a "Stockholder," as such terms may be defined in the
    Voting Agreement.

16. **[Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders]{.underline}.**

    a.  **[Legends]{.underline}.** Any stock certificate or, in the case
        of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the
        Shares shall bear the following legends (as well as any legends
        required by the Company or applicable state and federal
        corporate and securities laws):

        ii. "THE SECURITIES referenced herein MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN

             ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SECURITIES THAT DOES NOT COMPLY

    a.  **[Stop-Transfer Notices]{.underline}.** Purchaser agrees that,
        in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to
        herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer"
        instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the
        Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate
        notations to the same effect in its own records.

    b.  **[Refusal to Transfer]{.underline}.** The Company shall not be
        required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been
        sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the
        provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such
        Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any
        purchaser or other transferee to whom such Shares shall have
        been so transferred.

    c.  \[*For uncertificated securities:***[Required
        Notices]{.underline}.** Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares
        are issued and shall be held subject to all the provisions of
        this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
        of the Company and any amendments thereto, copies of which are
        on file at the principal office of the Company. A statement of
        all of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
        granted to or imposed upon the respective classes and/or series
        of shares of stock of the Company and upon the holders thereof
        may be obtained by any stockholder upon request and without
        charge, at the principal office of the Company, and the Company
        will furnish any stockholder, upon request and without charge, a
        copy of such statement. Purchaser acknowledges that the
        provisions of this Section 6 shall constitute the notices
        required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General
        Corporation Law and the Purchaser hereby expressly waives the
        requirement of Section 151(f) of the Delaware General
        Corporation Law that it receive the written notice provided for
        in Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General
        Corporation Law within a reasonable time after the issuance of
        the Shares.\]

17. **[No Employment Rights]{.underline}.** Nothing in this Agreement
    shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the
    Company, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, to
    terminate Purchaser's employment or consulting relationship, for any
    reason, with or without cause.

18. **[Waiver of Statutory Information Rights]{.underline}.** Purchaser
    acknowledges and understands that, but for the waiver made herein,
    Purchaser would be entitled, upon written demand under oath stating
    the purpose thereof, to inspect for any proper purpose, and to make
    copies and extracts from, the Company's stock ledger, a list of its
    stockholders, and its other books and records, and the books and
    records of subsidiaries of the Company, if any, under the
    circumstances and in the manner provided in Section 220 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law (any and all such rights, and any
    and all such other rights of Purchaser as may be provided for in
    Section 220, the "[Inspection Rights]{.underline}"). In light of the
    foregoing, until the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to
    the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with
    and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser hereby
    unconditionally and irrevocably waives the Inspection Rights,
    whether such Inspection Rights would be exercised or pursued
    directly or indirectly pursuant to Section 220 or otherwise, and
    covenants and agrees never to directly or indirectly commence,
    voluntarily aid in any way, prosecute, assign, transfer, or cause to
    be commenced any claim, action, cause of action, or other proceeding
    to pursue or exercise the Inspection Rights. The foregoing waiver
    applies to the Inspection Rights of Purchaser in Purchaser's
    capacity as a stockholder and shall not affect any rights of a
    director, in his or her capacity as such, under Section 220. The
    foregoing waiver shall not apply to any contractual inspection
    rights of Purchaser under any written agreement with the Company.

19. **[Miscellaneous]{.underline}.**

    a.  **[Governing Law]{.underline}.** The validity, interpretation,
        construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and
        transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of

        under the Plan, no modification of or amendment to this
        Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement,
        shall be effective unless in writing signed by the parties to
        this Agreement. No delay or failure to require performance of
        any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of

        provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and

    f.  **[Severability]{.underline}.** If one or more provisions of
        this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under Applicable
        Laws, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good
        faith. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually
        agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then
        (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement,
        (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
        such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the
        Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

    g.  **[Construction]{.underline}.** This Agreement is the result of
        negotiations between and has been reviewed by each of the
        parties hereto and their respective counsel, if any;
        accordingly, this Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of
        all of the parties hereto, and no ambiguity shall be construed
        in favor of or against any one of the parties hereto.

    h.  **[Counterparts]{.underline}.** This Agreement may be executed
        in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
        and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which
        together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution
        of a facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and
        effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned
        signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.
