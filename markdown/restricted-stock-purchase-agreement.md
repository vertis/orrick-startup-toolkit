[RESTRICTED Stock Purchase Agreement]{.underline}

This Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (this
"[Agreement]{.underline}") is made as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by and
between \[Company Name\], a Delaware corporation (the
"[Company]{.underline}"), and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
("[Purchaser]{.underline}") pursuant to the Company's \[Stock Plan
Name\] (the "[Plan]{.underline}"). To the extent any capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Plan.

1.  **[Sale of Stock]{.underline}.** Subject to the terms and conditions
    of this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
    this Agreement by the parties or on such other date as the Company
    and Purchaser shall agree (the "[Purchase Date]{.underline}"), the
    Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to
    purchase from the Company, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares of the
    Company's Common Stock (the "[Shares]{.underline}") at a purchase
    price of USD\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per share for a total purchase
    price of USD\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the "[Aggregate Purchase
    Price]{.underline}"). On the Purchase Date, Purchaser will deliver
    the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company and the Company will
    enter the Shares in Purchaser's name as of such date in the books
    and records of the Company or, if applicable, a duly authorized
    transfer agent of the Company. The Company will deliver to
    Purchaser\[, upon request, a notice of issuance with respect to\] /
    \[a stock certificate representing\] the Shares as soon as
    practicable following such date. As used elsewhere herein, the term
    "[Shares]{.underline}" refers to all of the Shares purchased
    hereunder and all securities received in connection with the Shares
    pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in
    replacement of the Shares in a recapitalization, merger,
    reorganization, exchange or the like, and all new, substituted or
    additional securities or other property to which Purchaser is
    entitled by reason of Purchaser's ownership of the Shares. By
    Purchaser's signature and the signature of the Company's
    representative below, Purchaser and the Company agree that this
    acquisition of Shares is governed by the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement and the \[Company Name\] \[Stock Plan Name\] which is
    attached to and made a part of this Agreement.

2.  **[Consideration]{.underline}.** Payment of the Aggregate Purchase
    Price shall be made by any method permitted by the Company and
    authorized under the Plan. In addition, Purchaser shall satisfy any
    applicable tax, withholding obligations, required deductions or
    other payments, all in accordance with the Plan.

3.  **[Limitations on Transfer]{.underline}.** \[*Use if Stock Plan
    contains transfer restrictions:* Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
    that the Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i)
    the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 12 of the Plan, (ii)
    the terms and conditions that apply to the Company's Common Stock,
    as set forth in the Company's Bylaws, \[including (without
    limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section 8.9
    of the Company's Bylaws, \]as may be in effect at the time of any
    proposed transfer (the "[Bylaw Provisions]{.underline}"), and (iii)
    any other limitation or restriction on transfer created by
    Applicable Laws.\] ***OR*** \[*Use ONLY IF Stock Plan DOES NOT
    INCLUDE transfer restrictions:* Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
    that the Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i)
    the terms and conditions that apply to the Company's Common Stock,
    as set forth in the Company's Bylaws, \[including (without
    limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section 8.9
    of the Company's Bylaws, \]as may be in effect at the time of any
    proposed transfer (the "[Bylaw Provisions]{.underline}"), and (ii)
    any other limitation or restriction on transfer created by
    Applicable Laws.\] In addition to the foregoing limitations on
    transfer, Purchaser shall not assign, encumber or dispose of any
    interest in the Shares while the Shares are subject to the Company's
    Repurchase Option (as defined below). After any Shares have been
    released from such Repurchase Option, Purchaser shall not assign,
    encumber or dispose of any interest in the Shares except to the
    extent permitted by, and in compliance with, \[Section 12 of the
    Plan, \] the Bylaw Provisions, Applicable Laws, and the provisions
    below.

    a.  **[Repurchase Option; Vesting]{.underline}.**

        i.  In the event of the voluntary or involuntary termination of
            Purchaser's Continuous Service Status for any reason
            (including, without limitation, resignation, death or
            Disability), with or without cause, the Company shall upon
            the date of such termination (the "[Termination
            Date]{.underline}") have an irrevocable, exclusive option
            (the "[Repurchase Option]{.underline}") for a period of
            \_\_\_\_\_ months from such date to repurchase all or any
            portion of the Unvested Shares (as defined below) held by
            Purchaser as of the Termination Date at the original
            purchase price per Share (adjusted for any stock splits,
            stock dividends and the like) specified in Section 1. As
            used in this Agreement, "[Unvested Shares]{.underline}"
            means Shares, if any, that have not yet been released from
            the Repurchase Option.

        ii. Unless the Company notifies Purchaser within \_\_\_\_\_
            months from the Termination Date that it does not intend to
            exercise its Repurchase Option with respect to some or all
            of the Unvested Shares, the Repurchase Option shall be
            deemed automatically exercised by the Company as of the end
            of such \_\_\_\_\_-month period following such Termination
            Date, provided that the Company may notify Purchaser that it
            is exercising its Repurchase Option as of a date prior to
            the end of such \_\_\_\_\_-month period. Unless Purchaser is
            otherwise notified by the Company pursuant to the preceding
            sentence that the Company does not intend to exercise its
            Repurchase Option as to some or all of the Unvested Shares
            to which it applies at the time of termination, execution of
            this Agreement by Purchaser constitutes written notice to
            Purchaser of the Company's intention to exercise its
            Repurchase Option with respect to all Unvested Shares to
            which such Repurchase Option applies. The Company, at its
            choice, may satisfy its payment obligation to Purchaser with
            respect to exercise of the Repurchase Option by either (A)
            delivering a check to Purchaser in the amount of the
            purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased,
            or (B) in the event Purchaser is indebted to the Company,
            canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the
            purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased,
            or (C) by a combination of (A) and (B) so that the combined
            payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals such
            purchase price. In the event of any deemed automatic
            exercise of the Repurchase Option pursuant to this
            Section 3(a)(iii) in which Purchaser is indebted to the
            Company, such indebtedness equal to the purchase price of
            the Unvested Shares being repurchased shall be deemed
            automatically canceled as of the end of the \_\_\_\_\_-month
            period following the Termination Date unless the Company
            otherwise satisfies its payment obligations. As a result of
            any repurchase of Unvested Shares pursuant to this
            Section 3(a), the Company shall become the legal and
            beneficial owner of the Unvested Shares being repurchased
            and shall have all rights and interest therein or related
            thereto, and the Company shall have the right to transfer to
            its own name the number of Unvested Shares being repurchased
            by the Company, without further action by Purchaser.

        iii. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_% of the Shares shall initially be
             subject to the Repurchase Option (the "[Vesting
             Shares]{.underline}"). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the Vesting
             Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option on
             \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and an additional
             \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the Vesting Shares shall be
             released from the Repurchase Option on the
             \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ day of each month thereafter \[(and if
             there is no corresponding day, the last day of the
             month)\], until all Vesting Shares are released from the
             Repurchase Option; provided, however, that such scheduled
             releases from the Repurchase Option shall immediately cease
             as of the Termination Date. Fractional shares shall be
             rounded down to the nearest whole share.

        iv. \[\[*If plan does not define the term:* As used in this
            Agreement, "[Change of Control]{.underline}" means a sale of
            all or substantially all of the Company's assets other than
            to an Excluded Entity (as defined below); a merger,
            consolidation or other capital reorganization or business
            combination transaction of the Company with or into another
            corporation, limited liability company or other entity other
            than an Excluded Entity; or the consummation of a
            transaction, or series of related transactions, in which any
            "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
            of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
            defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or
            indirectly, of all of the Company's then outstanding voting
            securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction
            shall not constitute a Change of Control if its purpose is
            to change the jurisdiction of the Company's incorporation,
            create a holding company that will be owned in substantially
            the same proportions by the persons who hold the Company's
            securities immediately before such transaction, or obtain
            funding for the Company in a financing that is approved by
            the Company's Board. An "[Excluded Entity]{.underline}"
            means a corporation, limited liability company or other
            entity of which the holders of voting capital stock of the
            Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction
            are the direct or indirect holders of voting securities
            representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be
            cast by all of such corporation's, limited liability
            company's or other entity's voting securities outstanding
            immediately after such transaction.\] \[*Single Trigger
            Acceleration:* Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of
            Control occurs the vesting of the Unvested Shares shall
            accelerate such that this Repurchase Option shall lapse as
            to \[\_\_\_\_%\] of the Unvested Shares, effective as of
            immediately prior to consummation of the Change of
            Control.\] **OR** \[*Double Trigger Acceleration:*
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser is terminated
            without Cause by the Company (or a successor, if
            appropriate) \[ or resigns for Good Reason (as defined
            below)\] and provided such termination \[ or resignation\]
            occurs in connection with or following the consummation of a
            Change of Control, then the vesting of the Unvested Shares
            shall accelerate such that the Repurchase Option in
            Section 3(a) shall lapse as to \[\_\_\_\_%\] of the Unvested
            Shares. The lapse of repurchase rights provided for in the
            previous sentence shall occur immediately prior to the
            Termination Date. \[In the case of a sale of all or
            substantially all of the Company's assets other than to an
            Excluded Entity, if the acquirer of the Company's assets
            does not agree to assume this Agreement, or to substitute an
            equivalent award or right for this Agreement, and Purchaser
            transfers his employment to such acquirer in connection with
            such asset sale transaction, then any acceleration of
            vesting that would otherwise occur upon Purchaser's
            termination shall occur immediately prior to, and contingent
            upon, the consummation of such asset sale transaction.\]
            \[As used in this Agreement, "[Good Reason]{.underline}"
            will mean Purchaser's resignation due to the occurrence of
            any of the following conditions which occurs without
            Purchaser's written consent, provided that the requirements
            regarding advance notice and an opportunity to cure set
            forth below are satisfied: a reduction of Purchaser's then
            current base salary by 10% or more unless such reduction is
            part of a generalized salary reduction affecting similarly
            situated employees; a change in Purchaser's position with
            the Company that materially reduces Purchaser's duties,
            level of authority or responsibility; or the Company
            conditions Purchaser's continued service with the Company on
            Purchaser's being transferred to a site of employment that
            would increase Purchaser's one-way commute by more than 35
            miles from Purchaser's then principal residence. In order
            for Purchaser to resign for Good Reason, Purchaser must
            provide written notice to the Company of the existence of
            the Good Reason condition within 60 days of the initial
            existence of such Good Reason condition. Upon receipt of
            such notice, the Company will have 30 days during which it
            may remedy the Good Reason condition and not be required to
            provide for the vesting acceleration described herein as a
            result of such proposed resignation. If the Good Reason
            condition is not remedied within such 30 day period,
            Purchaser may resign based on the Good Reason condition
            specified in the notice effective no later than 30 days
            following the expiration of the 30-day cure period.\] If
            Purchaser is a Director but not an Employee or Consultant of
            the Company (or a successor, if appropriate) at the time of
            consummation of the Change of Control and Purchaser is
            removed from, or is not reelected to, the Board of Directors
            of the Company (or a successor, as appropriate) in
            connection with or following the consummation of a Change of
            Control, the vesting of any Unvested Shares shall accelerate
            such that the Repurchase Option shall lapse to the same
            extent as if Purchaser had been terminated without Cause as
            described above.\]\]

    b.  **[Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Refusal]{.underline}.**
        Before any Shares held by Purchaser or any transferee of
        Purchaser (either being sometimes referred to herein as the
        "[Holder]{.underline}") may be sold or otherwise transferred
        (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the Company
        shall first, to the extent the Company's approval is required by
        the Plan or any applicable Bylaw Provisions, have the right to
        approve such sale or transfer, in full or in part, and shall
        then have the right to purchase all or any part of the Shares
        proposed to be sold or transferred, in each case, in its sole
        and absolute discretion (the "[Right of First
        Refusal]{.underline}"). If the Holder would like to sell or
        transfer any Shares, the Holder must provide the Company or its
        assignee(s) with a Notice (as defined below) requesting approval
        to sell or transfer the Shares and offering the Company or its
        assignee(s) a Right of First Refusal on the same terms and
        conditions set forth in this Section 3(b). The Company may
        either (1) exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in
        part and purchase such Shares pursuant to this Section 3(b),
        (2) decline to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in
        part and permit the transfer of such Shares to the Proposed
        Transferee (as defined below) in full or in part or (3) decline
        to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and,
        to the extent the Company's approval is required by the Plan or
        any applicable Bylaw Provisions, decline the request to sell or
        transfer the Shares in full or in part.

        i.  **[Notice of Proposed Transfer]{.underline}.** The Holder of
            the Shares shall deliver to the Company a written notice
            (the "[Notice]{.underline}") stating: (A) the Holder's
            intention to sell or otherwise transfer such Shares; (B) the
            name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee
            ("[Proposed Transferee]{.underline}"); (C) the number of
            Shares to be sold or transferred to each Proposed
            Transferee; (D) the terms and conditions of each proposed
            sale or transfer, including (without limitation) the
            purchase price for such Shares (the "[Transfer Purchase
            Price]{.underline}"); and (E) the Holder's offer to the
            Company or its assignee(s) to purchase the Shares at the
            Transfer Purchase Price and upon the same terms (or terms
            that are no less favorable to the Company).

        ii. **[Exercise of Right of First Refusal]{.underline}.** At any
            time within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, the Company
            and/or its assignee(s) shall deliver a written notice to the
            Holder indicating whether the Company and/or its assignee(s)
            elect to permit or reject the proposed sale or transfer, in
            full or in part, and/or elect to accept or decline the offer
            to purchase any or all of the Shares proposed to be sold or
            transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees,
            at the Transfer Purchase Price, provided that if the
            Transfer Purchase Price consists of no legal consideration
            (as, for example, in the case of a transfer by gift), the
            purchase price will be the fair market value of the Shares
            as determined in good faith by the Company. If the Transfer
            Purchase Price includes consideration other than cash, the
            cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration shall be
            determined by the Company in good faith.

        iii. **[Payment]{.underline}.** Payment of the Transfer Purchase
             Price shall be made, at the election of the Company or its
             assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or
             a portion of any outstanding indebtedness, or by any
             combination thereof within 60 days after receipt of the
             Notice or in the manner and at the times set forth in the
             Notice.

        iv. **[Holder's Right to Transfer]{.underline}.** If any of the
            Shares proposed in the Notice to be sold or transferred to a
            given Proposed Transferee are both (A) not purchased by the
            Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this
            Section 3(b) [and]{.underline} (B) approved by the Company
            to be sold or transferred, then the Holder may sell or
            otherwise transfer any such Shares to the applicable
            Proposed Transferee at the Transfer Purchase Price or at a
            higher price, provided that such sale or other transfer is
            consummated within 120 days after the date of the Notice;
            provided that any such sale or other transfer is also
            effected in accordance with the Bylaw Provisions \[*Use if
            Stock Plan contains transfer restrictions:* , the transfer
            restrictions set forth in the Plan\] and any Applicable Laws
            and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the Plan,
            the Bylaw Provisions and the provisions of this Agreement,
            including this Section 3 and the waiver of statutory
            information rights in Section 10 shall continue to apply to
            the Shares in the hands of such Proposed Transferee. The
            Company, in consultation with its legal counsel, may require
            the Holder to provide an opinion of counsel evidencing
            compliance with Applicable Laws. If the Shares described in
            the Notice are not transferred to the Proposed Transferee
            within such period, or if the Holder proposes to change the
            price or other terms to make them more favorable to the
            Proposed Transferee, a new Notice shall be given to the
            Company, and the Company and/or its assignees shall again
            have the right to approve such transfer and be offered the
            Right of First Refusal.

        v.  **[Exception for Certain Family Transfers]{.underline}.**
            Anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3(b)
            notwithstanding, the transfer of any or all of the Shares
            during Holder's lifetime or on Holder's death by will or
            intestacy to Holder's Immediate Family or a trust for the
            benefit of Holder or Holder's Immediate Family shall be
            exempt from the provisions of this Section 3(b). "[Immediate
            Family]{.underline}" as used herein shall mean lineal
            descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse's antecedents),
            father, mother, brother or sister (or their descendants),
            stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or
            uncle (or their antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law
            or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or descendants) and
            shall include adoptive relationships, or any person sharing
            Holder's household (other than a tenant or an employee). In
            such case, the transferee or other recipient shall receive
            and hold the Shares so transferred subject to the provisions
            of the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions and the provisions of this
            Agreement, including this Section 3 and Section 10, and
            there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in
            accordance with the terms of this Section 3\[, the Plan,\]
            and the Bylaw Provisions.

    c.  **[Company's Right to Purchase upon Involuntary
        Transfer]{.underline}.** In the event of any transfer by
        operation of law or other involuntary transfer (including death
        or divorce, but excluding a transfer to Immediate Family as set
        forth in Section 3(b)(v) above) of all or a portion of the
        Shares by the record holder thereof, the Company shall have an
        option to purchase any or all of the Shares transferred at the
        Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of transfer (as
        determined by the Company in its sole discretion). Upon such a
        transfer, the Holder shall promptly notify the Secretary of the
        Company of such transfer. The right to purchase such Shares
        shall be provided to the Company for a period of 30 days
        following receipt by the Company of written notice from the
        Holder.

    d.  **[Assignment]{.underline}.** The right of the Company to
        purchase any part of the Shares may be assigned in whole or in
        part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the Company or
        other persons or organizations.

    e.  **[Restrictions Binding on Transferees]{.underline}.** All
        transferees of Shares or any interest therein will receive and
        hold such Shares or interest subject to the Plan, the Bylaw
        Provisions and the provisions of this Agreement, including,
        without limitation, Sections 3 and 10 of this Agreement\[ and
        Section 12 of the Plan\], including, insofar as applicable, the
        Repurchase Option. In the event of any purchase by the Company
        hereunder where the Shares or interest are held by a transferee,
        the transferee shall be obligated, if requested by the Company,
        to transfer the Shares or interest to Purchaser for
        consideration equal to the amount to be paid by the Company
        hereunder. In the event the Repurchase Option is deemed
        exercised by the Company pursuant to Section 3(a)(ii) hereof,
        the Company may deem any transferee to have transferred the
        Shares or interest to Purchaser prior to their purchase by the
        Company, and payment of the purchase price by the Company to
        such transferee shall be deemed to satisfy Purchaser's
        obligation to pay such transferee for such Shares or interest,
        and also to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay Purchaser
        for such Shares or interest. Any sale or transfer of the Shares
        shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are
        satisfied.

    f.  **[Termination of Rights]{.underline}.** The transfer
        restrictions set forth in Section 3(b) above\[ and Section 12 of
        the Plan\], the Right of First Refusal granted the Company by
        Section 3(b) above and the right to repurchase the Shares in the
        event of an involuntary transfer granted the Company by
        Section 3(c) above shall terminate upon the first sale of Common
        Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a
        registration statement filed with and declared effective by the
        Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
        (other than a registration statement relating solely to the
        issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or
        an employee incentive or benefit plan) or any transfer or
        conversion of Shares made pursuant to a statutory merger or
        statutory consolidation of the Company with or into another
        corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving
        corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof
        is registered under the Exchange Act.

    g.  **[Lock-Up Agreement]{.underline}.** If so requested by the
        Company or the underwriters in connection with the initial
        public offering of the Company's securities registered under the
        Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser shall not sell,
        make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase
        of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company
        however or whenever acquired (except for those being registered)
        without the prior written consent of the Company or such
        underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from the
        effective date of the registration statement, and Purchaser
        shall execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be
        requested by the underwriters at the time of such offering.

4.  **[Escrow of Unvested Shares]{.underline}.** For purposes of
    facilitating the enforcement of the provisions of Section 3 above,
    Purchaser agrees to deliver a Stock Power in the form attached to
    this Agreement as [Exhibit A]{.underline} executed by Purchaser and
    by Purchaser's spouse (if required for transfer), in blank, and such
    stock certificate(s), if any, to the Secretary of the Company, or
    the Secretary's designee, to hold such Shares (and stock
    certificate(s), if any) and Stock Power in escrow and to take all
    such actions and to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as
    are required in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
    Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Secretary of the Company, or
    the Secretary's designee, is so appointed as the escrow holder with
    the foregoing authorities as a material inducement to make this
    Agreement and that said appointment is coupled with an interest and
    is accordingly irrevocable. Purchaser agrees that said escrow holder
    shall not be liable to any party hereof (or to any other party). The
    escrow holder may rely upon any letter, notice or other document
    executed by any signature purported to be genuine and may resign at
    any time. Purchaser agrees that if the Secretary of the Company, or
    the Secretary's designee, resigns as escrow holder for any or no
    reason, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power
    to appoint a successor to serve as escrow holder pursuant to the
    terms of this Agreement.

5.  **[Investment and Taxation Representations]{.underline}.** In
    connection with the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser represents to
    the Company the following:

    a.  Purchaser is aware of the Company's business affairs and
        financial condition and has acquired sufficient information
        about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
        decision to acquire the Shares. Purchaser is purchasing the
        Shares for investment for Purchaser's own account only and not
        with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
        "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act
        or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does
        not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any
        other person or entity.

    b.  Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered
        under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption
        therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the
        bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed
        herein.

    c.  Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the
        securities must be held indefinitely unless they are
        subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
        from such registration is available. Purchaser further
        acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no
        obligation to register the securities.

    d.  Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144,
        promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance,
        permits limited public resale of "restricted securities"
        acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the
        securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a
        non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain
        conditions. Purchaser understands that the Company provides no
        assurances as to whether he or she will be able to resell any or
        all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires,
        among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting
        requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities
        take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the
        Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain
        circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume
        and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions.
        Notwithstanding this Section 5(d), Purchaser acknowledges and
        agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 5(e) below.

    e.  Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the
        applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied,
        registration under the Securities Act, compliance with
        Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be
        required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is
        not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to
        sell private placement securities other than in a registered
        offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a
        substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption
        from registration is available for such offers or sales, and
        that such persons and their respective brokers who participate
        in such transactions do so at their own risk.

    f.  Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the
        "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i)
        to (viii) under the Securities Act. Purchaser also agrees to
        notify the Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such
        disqualifications after the date hereof.

    g.  Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax
        consequences as a result of Purchaser's purchase or disposition
        of the Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted
        any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with
        the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is
        not relying on the Company for any tax advice.

6.  **[Voting Provisions]{.underline}.** As a condition precedent to
    entering into this Agreement, at the request of the Company,
    Purchaser shall become a party to any voting agreement to which the
    Company is a party at the time of Purchaser's execution and delivery
    of this Agreement, as such voting agreement may be thereafter
    amended from time to time (the "[Voting Agreement]{.underline}"), by
    executing an adoption agreement or counterpart signature page
    agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of the Voting
    Agreement and to vote the Shares in the capacity of a "Common
    Holder" and a "Stockholder," as such terms may be defined in the
    Voting Agreement.

7.  **[Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders]{.underline}.**

    a.  **[Legends]{.underline}.** Any stock certificate or, in the case
        of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the
        Shares, shall bear the following legends (as well as any legends
        required by the Company or applicable state and federal
        corporate and securities laws):

        i.  "THE SECURITIES REFERENCED HEREIN HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
            UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
            INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
            THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH SALE OR
            DISTRIBUTION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE
            REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF
            COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH
            REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
            1933."

        ii. "THE SECURITIES referenced herein MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN
            ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
            Company AND THE stockholder, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH
            AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE Company at no
            charge."

        iii. \["THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES referenced herein IS
             SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE
             COMPANY'S \[BYLAWS\] **AND/OR** \[ And Stock PLAN\], COPIES
             OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE
             COMPANY AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY
             SHALL NOT REGISTER OR OTHERWISE RECOGNIZE OR GIVE EFFECT TO
             ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SECURITIES THAT DOES NOT COMPLY
             WITH SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS."\]

        iv. Any legend required by the Voting Agreement, as applicable.

    b.  **[Stop-Transfer Notices]{.underline}.** Purchaser agrees that,
        in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to
        herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer"
        instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the
        Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate
        notations to the same effect in its own records.

    c.  **[Refusal to Transfer]{.underline}.** The Company shall not be
        required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been
        sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the
        provisions of this Agreement or the Plan or (ii) to treat as
        owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay
        dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such
        Shares shall have been so transferred.

    d.  **[Legend and Notice Removal]{.underline}.** When all of the
        following events have occurred, the Shares then held by
        Purchaser will no longer be subject to the legend specified in
        Section 7(a)(ii) and the Company will remove any stop-transfer
        notices associated with the transfer restrictions imposed by
        this Agreement:

        i.  the termination of the Right of First Refusal;

        ii. the expiration or exercise in full of the Repurchase Option;

        iii. the expiration or termination of the lock-up provisions of
             Section 3(g) (and of any agreement entered pursuant to
             Section 3(g)); and

        iv. the termination of the waiver of statutory information
            rights set forth in Section 10.

After such time and upon Purchaser's request, a new stock certificate
or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for
the remaining Shares, shall be issued without the legend specified in
Section 7(a)(ii) and delivered to Purchaser.

e.  \[*For uncertificated securities:***[Required
    Notices]{.underline}.** Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares are
    issued and shall be held subject to all the provisions of this
    Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
    Company and any amendments thereto, copies of which are on file at
    the principal office of the Company. A statement of all of the
    rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or
    imposed upon the respective classes and/or series of shares of stock
    of the Company and upon the holders thereof may be obtained by any
    stockholder upon request and without charge, at the principal office
    of the Company, and the Company will furnish any stockholder, upon
    request and without charge, a copy of such statement. Purchaser
    acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 7(e) shall
    constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law and Purchaser hereby expressly
    waives the requirement of Section 151(f) of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law that it receive the written notice provided for in
    Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    within a reasonable time after the issuance of the Shares.\]

8.  **[No Employment Rights]{.underline}.** Nothing in this Agreement
    shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the
    Company, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, to
    terminate Purchaser's employment or consulting relationship, for any
    reason, with or without cause.

9.  **[Section 83(b) Election]{.underline}.** Purchaser understands that
    Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    "[Code]{.underline}"), taxes as ordinary income the difference
    between the amount paid for the Shares and the Fair Market Value of
    the Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse. In
    this context, "[restriction]{.underline}" means the right of the
    Company to buy back the Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Option set
    forth in Section 3(a) above of this Agreement. Purchaser understands
    that Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are
    purchased, rather than when and as the Repurchase Option expires, by
    filing an election under Section 83(b) (an "[83(b)
    Election]{.underline}") of the Code with the Internal Revenue
    Service within 30 days from the date of purchase. Even if the Fair
    Market Value of the Shares at the time of the execution of this
    Agreement equals the amount paid for the Shares, the election must
    be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future. Purchaser
    understands that failure to file such an election in a timely manner
    may result in adverse tax consequences for Purchaser. Purchaser
    further understands that an additional copy of such election form
    should be filed with Purchaser's federal income tax return for the
    calendar year in which the date of this Agreement falls. Purchaser
    acknowledges that the foregoing is only a summary of the effect of
    United States federal income taxation with respect to purchase of
    the Shares hereunder, does not purport to be complete, and is not
    intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes
    of avoiding taxpayer penalties. Purchaser further acknowledges that
    the Company has directed Purchaser to seek independent advice
    regarding the applicable provisions of the Code, the income tax laws
    of any municipality, state or foreign country in which Purchaser may
    reside, and the tax consequences of Purchaser's death, and Purchaser
    has consulted, and has been fully advised by, Purchaser's own tax
    advisor regarding such tax laws and tax consequences or has
    knowingly chosen not to consult such a tax advisor. Purchaser
    further acknowledges that neither the Company nor any subsidiary or
    representative of the Company has made any warranty or
    representation to Purchaser with respect to the tax consequences of
    Purchaser's purchase of the Shares or of the making or failure to
    make an 83(b) Election. PURCHASER (AND NOT THE COMPANY, ITS AGENTS
    OR ANY OTHER PERSON) SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROPRIATELY
    FILING SUCH FORM WITH THE IRS, EVEN IF PURCHASER REQUESTS THE
    COMPANY, ITS AGENTS OR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKE THIS FILING ON
    PURCHASER'S BEHALF.

Purchaser agrees that Purchaser will execute and deliver to the Company
with this executed Agreement a copy of the Acknowledgment and Statement
of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election (the
"[Acknowledgment]{.underline}"), attached hereto as
[Exhibit B]{.underline} and, if Purchaser decides to make an 83(b)
Election, a copy of the 83(b) Election, attached hereto as
[Exhibit C]{.underline}.

10. **[Waiver of Statutory Information Rights]{.underline}.** Purchaser
    acknowledges and understands that, but for the waiver made herein,
    Purchaser would be entitled, upon written demand under oath stating
    the purpose thereof, to inspect for any proper purpose, and to make
    copies and extracts from, the Company's stock ledger, a list of its
    stockholders, and its other books and records, and the books and
    records of subsidiaries of the Company, if any, under the
    circumstances and in the manner provided in Section 220 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law (any and all such rights, and any
    and all such other rights of Purchaser as may be provided for in
    Section 220, the "[Inspection Rights]{.underline}"). In light of the
    foregoing, until the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to
    the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with
    and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser hereby
    unconditionally and irrevocably waives the Inspection Rights,
    whether such Inspection Rights would be exercised or pursued
    directly or indirectly pursuant to Section 220 or otherwise, and
    covenants and agrees never to directly or indirectly commence,
    voluntarily aid in any way, prosecute, assign, transfer, or cause to
    be commenced any claim, action, cause of action, or other proceeding
    to pursue or exercise the Inspection Rights. The foregoing waiver
    applies to the Inspection Rights of Purchaser in Purchaser's
    capacity as a stockholder and shall not affect any rights of a
    director, in his or her capacity as such, under Section 220. The
    foregoing waiver shall not apply to any contractual inspection
    rights of Purchaser under any written agreement with the Company.

11. **[Miscellaneous]{.underline}.**

    a.  **[Governing Law]{.underline}.** The validity, interpretation,
        construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and
        transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of
        the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted
        in accordance with the laws of the state of \[California\],
        without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For
        purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or
        indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and
        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state of
        \[California\] and agree that any such litigation shall be
        conducted only in the courts of \[California\] or the federal
        courts of the United States located in \[California\] and no
        other courts.

    b.  **[Entire Agreement]{.underline}.** This Agreement, together
        with the Plan, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding
        of the parties relating to the subject matter herein and
        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions,
        understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between
        them related to the subject matter thereof.

    c.  **[Amendments and Waivers]{.underline}.** Except as contemplated
        under the Plan, no modification of or amendment to this
        Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement,
        shall be effective unless in writing signed by the parties to
        this Agreement. No delay or failure to require performance of
        any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of
        that provision as to that or any other instance.

    d.  **[Successors and Assigns]{.underline}.** Except as otherwise
        provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and
        obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and
        inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns,
        heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. The
        Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this
        Agreement. No other party to this Agreement may assign, whether
        voluntarily or by operation of law, any of its rights and
        obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written
        consent of the Company.

    e.  **[Notices]{.underline}.** Any notice, demand or request
        required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be
        in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered
        personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours
        after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or
        registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to
        be notified at such party's address as set forth on the
        signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or
        if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most
        recent address set forth in the Company's books and records.

    f.  **[Severability]{.underline}.** If one or more provisions of
        this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable
        law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good
        faith. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually
        agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then
        (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement,
        (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
        such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the
        Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

    g.  **[Construction]{.underline}.** This Agreement is the result of
        negotiations between and has been reviewed by each of the
        parties hereto and their respective counsel, if any;
        accordingly, this Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of
        all of the parties hereto, and no ambiguity shall be construed
        in favor of or against any one of the parties hereto.

    h.  **[Counterparts]{.underline}.** This Agreement may be executed
        in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
        and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which
        together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution
        of a facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and
        effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned
        signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.

    i.  **[Electronic Delivery]{.underline}.** The Company may, in its
        sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to this
        Agreement or any notices required by applicable law or the
        Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws by email or any
        other electronic means. Purchaser hereby consents to (i) conduct
        business electronically, (ii) receive such documents and notices
        by such electronic delivery and (iii) sign documents
        electronically and agrees to participate through an on-line or
        electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a
        third party designated by the Company.

    j.  **[Imposition of Other Requirements]{.underline}.** The Company
