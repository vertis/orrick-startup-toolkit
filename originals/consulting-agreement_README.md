# Consulting Agreement

This form is designed to be used for each of the Company's consultants, including both individuals and entities providing services to the Company as independent contractors instead of employees. The distinction between independent contractors and employees is complex and requires advice of counsel. You should make sure you discuss this form with your counsel before using it. It is generally appropriate for the Company to generate the initial drafts of consulting agreements for review by counsel.
