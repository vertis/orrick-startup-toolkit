# Employee Offer Letter

This form is designed to be used by the Company for rank-and-file employees. Generally a Company would need a full-blown employment agreement for the CEO and certain key executive officers of the Company; such an agreement is beyond the scope of public forms posted here. Everyone else would typically sign this much shorter and simpler form of Offer Letter. Make sure you get advice from counsel before using this form for the first time so that your counsel can warn you about the usual pitfalls for start-ups such as failing to pay attention to minimum wage requirements.
