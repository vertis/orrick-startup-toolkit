# Nondisclosure Agreement (Mutual)

This is a mutual nondisclosure agreement, meaning that it applies equally to both parties and requires both to keep the other's information confidential, etc. This is a relatively standard form designed to be used in routine situations where a mutual NDA is required. It is not sufficient for a significant transaction like selling the entire business, but it is generally appropriate for meeting with potential investors, potential strategic partners or potential service providers who have not yet joined the Company and signed the full blown Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement. This will enable the Company to have fairly high level discussions with third parties and share high level information about the Companyâ€™s business plan and strategic direction. It is important to check with counsel in each instance to ensure that this is the right form for the particular information you intend to share.
